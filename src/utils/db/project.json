Basic PM Slides\nWho will be the sponsor?\nWas this project type done before?\nWhat metric or goal will this project affect?\nHas the business problem been clearly stated?\nWhy are we doing this project?\n\nUnerstanding a project's background establishes a solid foundation for the project.\n\nAt a minimum, it would be important to know who initiated the project, how the project was initiated, and why it was initiated. \n\nThe more you know and understand about the background the better.  Has this project type been done before, if so what were the results? Are there any related successes that can be cloned or leveraged? What metric or goal will this project affect? Has the business problem been clearly stated?  The steps may change as your project evolves. Describing your project's background is the first title, or step in your project plan, (Changed 7-30-19, Not Uploaded)\n\nGather project background information.  Describe why this project is needed, how it supports the organization’s goals, what problem it will solve, & what the key requirements are.  Pre-launch information is preliminary, gather what’s available, expanded & clarify the information as the project progresses.\n\n Projects solve or minimize problems & or create new opportunities.  Having a clear description of the problem or problems to be addressed will create focus.  Ensuring that all team members have a common understanding of the problem will enable project success.  If key individuals don't agree with the problem, they won't agree with the proposed solution.\n\n​Gather project background information.  Describe why this project is needed, how it supports the organization’s goals, what problem it will solve, & what the key requirements are.  Pre-launch information is preliminary, gather what’s available, expanded & clarify the information as the project progresses.\n\n Brainstorm the presenting / initial idea to determine its scope & the viability of moving forward.  Ideas for projects & action items can come from many places.  They can be the result of senior management planning, customer requirements, employee suggestions, responses to daily problems, suggestions for leveraging new technology, etc., etc., etc.  Recognize that the presenting idea can change as you apply the project management process,  How ideas are handled are determined by the organization's culture.  An open & collaborative culture will welcome new ideas & have a way to process the idea while closed organizations may limit & even discourage new ideas.\n\n​\n\nThe key question to automatically ask whenever a new idea surfaces is: What problem will this solve?

The difference between effective and less effective project managers is whether the most important things get done.  While it would be great for all the identified work within a project to be completed on time, on budget, & per specifications; sometimes that’s just not feasible.

The project manager’s role is to help move everyone to a common understanding & agreement.  The project process is designed to enable gaining consensus on the project’s elements.\n\n \n\nDefine the teams required & each team member’s role and specific responsibilities for the project.

Verify you have all required background information and are ready to launch the project. Projects started in haste without adequate information typically become problem projects. Describe how the project will be launched. Define the teams, at a minimum you'll have a core team, with the members that will be actively involved throughout the entire project. Many projects, also require extended teams, that work on specific portions of the project. Your project team can be your biggest asset, it can also be your biggest risk. Take the time to get to know every team member, and develop effective relationships. If you would like more detail for this step, say Project Launch or Teams. When you have sufficient information, continue to the next step by saying, Step Three. (Changed 8-02-19, Not Uploaded)\n\n",

The tasks to produce a deliverable have a beginning and an end, rolling up the dates for all the project's deliverables becomes the project's estimated schedule. Completion criteria for this step is to have identified the project's deliverables, and the key tasks for producing each deliverable.

Additional requirements can come from multiple groups, such as customers, management, project sponsor, stakeholders, users of the intended solution, groups impacted by the problem and proposed solution, regulators, citizens, and local, state, and federal government. Identify the groups that will be providing the summary and detailed requirements for your project. Consider meeting with representatives from the key groups, facilitate a session for gathering the following information, group's goals and objective for the project, their needs and wants, their current state, key assumptions, solution requirements, technology requirements, quality requirements, and organizational considerations.  Ask open ended questions, document the requirements, review each requirement, decide which ones will be met, provide feedback to the groups explaining the results of the meetings, decisions and reasons for the actions to be taken.

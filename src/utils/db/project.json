Additional requirements can come from multiple groups, such as customers, management, project sponsor, stakeholders, users of the intended solution, groups impacted by the problem and proposed solution, regulators, citizens, and local, state, and federal government. Identify the groups that will be providing the summary and detailed requirements for your project. Consider meeting with representatives from the key groups, facilitate a session for gathering the following information, group's goals and objective for the project, their needs and wants, their current state, key assumptions, solution requirements, technology requirements, quality requirements, and organizational considerations.  Ask open ended questions, document the requirements, review each requirement, decide which ones will be met, provide feedback to the groups explaining the results of the meetings, decisions and reasons for the actions to be taken. If you would like more detail for this step, say Project Requirements, When you have sufficient information, continue to the next step by saying, Step Eight.\n\n\n",

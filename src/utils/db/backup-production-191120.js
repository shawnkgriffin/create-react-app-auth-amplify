Additional requirements can come from multiple groups, such as customers, management, project sponsor, stakeholders, users of the intended solution, groups impacted by the problem and proposed solution, regulators, citizens, and local, state, and federal government. Identify the groups that will be providing the summary and detailed requirements for your project. Consider meeting with representatives from the key groups, facilitate a session for gathering the following information, group's goals and objective for the project, their needs and wants, their current state, key assumptions, solution requirements, technology requirements, quality requirements, and organizational considerations.  Ask open ended questions, document the requirements, review each requirement, decide which ones will be met, provide feedback to the groups explaining the results of the meetings, decisions and reasons for the actions to be taken. If you would like more detail for this step, say Project Requirements, When you have sufficient information, continue to the next step by saying, Step Eight.\n\n\n",

Additional requirements can come from multiple groups, such as customers, management, project sponsor, stakeholders, users of the intended solution, groups impacted by the problem and proposed solution, regulators, citizens, and local, state, and federal government. Identify the groups that will be providing the summary and detailed requirements for your project. Consider meeting with representatives from the key groups, facilitate a session for gathering the following information, group's goals and objective for the project, their needs and wants, their current state, key assumptions, solution requirements, technology requirements, quality requirements, and organizational considerations.  Ask open ended questions, document the requirements, review each requirement, decide which ones will be met, provide feedback to the groups explaining the results of the meetings, decisions and reasons for the actions to be taken. If you would like more detail for this step, say Project Requirements, When you have sufficient information, continue to the next step by saying, Step Eight.\n\n\n",

      "help": "Basic Template:\n\nWhy and When to Use - It's designed to help new and relatively new project managers and team members learn best practices while doing projects.\n\nHow To Use - It can be the foundation for any project. It's a starting point, not a total solution.  Modify and tailor as you go, try some of the other templates, and create your own templates as you progress.\n\nProject Plan - The first deliverable is the project plan. The Basic template has 10 recommended work packages for creating the project plan. Large complex projects may require more, starting with these 10 will help you determine if you need more. Delete the ones you don't need & add others as required. \n\nDeliverable # 1 - contains generic work packages describing a logic progression for creating a typical deliverable. Work packages include the tasks required to create the deliverable, enter work packages for your deliverables that go from defining the deliverable, to developing it, to implementing it. \n\nCommunication, Training, and Coaching - Projects create change, change needs to be communicated and very often requires training and or coaching. The communication & training deliverables are included so they are considered and not forgotten. Sometimes communication & training can be included  within other project deliverables. If they are not required delete them, tailor the work packages for your project.\n\nProject Deliverables - Projects create deliverables that currently don't exist, or they modify existing deliverables. The first deliverable for any project is the project plan. Doing the first four work packages for creating the project plan will help you to identify your project's deliverables. \n\nWork Packages - Select the first work package under Project Plan, \n\"Assess the project background,\" scroll down to the work package status bar, enter who's assigned, and the start date.  Assign other work packages that can be done in parallel. Use short interval planning by focusing on what needs to be completed week by week and share it in Project Priority. \n\nQuestions - Scroll down and begin answering the questions. Delete questions not appropriate for your project, add additional questions to help guide the work and remind the team to consider key items while doing their work. As you select Yes the percentage of Yes is calculated against the total number of questions and displayed on the work package bar, alongside the work package, and rolled up to the project summary. Write questions you add so that the desired answer is Yes. As you complete a work package delete the questions you've answered No, so the percentage becomes 100%.\n\nNotes - While doing a work package record key information regarding your project in notes. Copy & paste notes into emails and other documents to share.\n\nGuidance - Each deliverable and work package have guidance to describe the work. Enter your own guidance to create a tailored template for your team and company. Encourage your team to check the guidance for their assigned work. \n\nTasks - (TBD) Select the Tasks button on the work package status bar to enter the tasks for a work package. Entering tasks can clarify the detail work required when it may not be understood, only enter what's necessary.\n",

Describe how the project will be \n  launched. \n\n- Define the teams, at a minimum you'll have a core team, with the \n  members that will be actively involved throughout the entire \n  project. \n\n- Many projects, also require extended teams, that work on \n  specific portions of the project. \n\n- Your project team can be your biggest asset, it can also be your \n  biggest risk. \n\n- Take the time to get to know every team member, and develop \n  effective relationships. \n\n- The more significant the project the more administration will be \n  required and the more you'll want to establish the administration \n  prior to the launch\n\n- It's important to have the project's sponsor and core team \n  actively participate in the launch\n\n- Research confirms that projects with active sponsors are always \n  more successful than projects without sponsors\n\nProject Teams:\n    - How many & what kind of teams will be required?\n    - Who’s the project sponsor & what’s the sponsor’s involvement \n      in the project?\n    - Who are key project stakeholders & what’s their involvement in \n      the project?\n    - Who’s the project manager & team leader for each team or \n      sub-team?\n    - What departments need to be represented on the project core \n      team?\n    - Who are the core team members & what are their roles & \n      responsibilities?\n    - What skills are required on the project core team?\n    - How often & when will project team meetings be held?\n    - Who will be required to participate in project team meetings?\n    - How will project team decisions be made?\n    - How will project team meetings be managed?\n    - What’s the escalation process?\n    - How will project team performance issues be handled?\n    - Who will record & track the schedule, action items & issues?\n    - Who will record assumptions?\n    - What automated tools will be used?\n    - Do team members need any training?\n\nProject Sponsors:\n  - Sponsors will generally be Senior Managers who have ultimate \n    responsibility for the successful completion of Business \n    Initiatives\n  - Sponsor Responsibilities Gives direction to the project\n  - Obtains necessary resources including commitment of people & \n    hours across the organization\n  - Secures management agreements\n  - Provides regular reports to management team\n  - Is committed to ensuring results are achieved\n  - Provides assistance / guidance to project manager\n  - Provides political support\n  - The sponsor will usually be involved in launching the project. \n  - It is recommended that all projects have a sponsor.\n  - The sponsor helps set the project’s direction, goals, & \n    objectives\n\nEvery Project requires a Project Manager who…..\n  - Takes the lead position in the project\n  - Facilitates the project and team process\n  - Collaborates with the team to create and execute the project \n    plan\n  - Monitors and documents the progress of all project work\n  - Reports to the Sponsor on Project Progress\n  - Facilitates & develops reporting updates to the cross-functional \n    Project Management Steering Committee\n\nThe larger, the more complex, the more critical the project the more the project manager needs to be a planner, manager, negotiator, facilitator, & communicator & not a doer.\n\nProject managers get things done.  The difference between effective and less effective project managers is whether the most important things get done.  \n\nWhile it would be great for all the identified work within a project to be completed on time, on budget, & per specifications; sometimes that’s just not feasible.  For that reason it’s important to identify & ensure that the most important or critical work is completed producing the most important or critical deliverables.\n\n​​Project managers ensure predictable results by following a defined process\n   - Develop effective habits\n   - Ask probing open ended questions\n   - Influence required behavior change\n\nWhen selecting the project manager: \n   - Understand the involvement in previous projects\n   - What's the background in project management methods and \n     tools\n   - What's the time required for this project and time availability to \n     meet the requirements.\n   - Understands and able to work with team member styles\n\nWhat Do Project Managers Do?\n1. Defines project goals, objectives, and requirements (with \n    sponsor)\n2. Builds consensus and facilitates conflict resolution\n3. Defines the project scope, WBS, & Network Diagram (if \n    required) \n4. Sets priorities and makes recommendations\n5. Forms and leads the project team & publishes all plans\n6. Ensures completion of all deliverables\n7. Minimize surprises\n8. Recognizes and rewards accomplishments and successes\n9. Provides direct communication with the sponsor\n10. Monitors delivery against all plans and commitments\n11. Coordinates and supports the project team\n12. Identifies & mitigates risk\n13. Controls changes\n14. Focal point for issues, questions, and enhancements\n15. Chairs project team meetings\n16. Facilitates problem resolution\n17. Involved in all project communication\n18. Maintains focus on behavior change required to produce the \n      committed results\n19. Manages activities during each stage\n20. Rewards team performance\n\nThe Bottom Line:\nProject managers get things done, the difference between effective and less effective project managers is whether the most important things get done.\n\n\nTeam Member Responsibilities:\n  - Understand, help develop, and support project direction, business results, & goals\n  - Participate in planning, as needed\n  - Accountable for completing tasks\n  - Support each other and the project manager\n  - Participate in problem resolution\n  - Report status, uncover issues, & communicate\n  - Keep your supervisor / manager informed of your work & time \n    commitments \n  - Participate in all reviews and audits\n\nEstablish Team Operating Procedures to Reduce Conflict:\n  - Define roles and responsibilities\n  - Establish expectations\n  - Define meeting schedules\n  - Describe the meeting process\n  - Identify automated & manual tools\n  - Establish decision making & escalation process\n  - Value individual feedback\n  - Define performance management\n  - Define documentation requirements, process, and \n    responsibilities\n  - Identify team training and development requirements\n\n",

              "help": "  - This step is the heart of your project.\n\n  - Projects produce, create, and implement deliverables. \n\n  - A deliverable is a thing, and should sound like a noun. \n\n  - We create deliverables by doing work, or tasks. \n\n  - Tasks start with a verb. Develop, design, initiate, etc, \n\n  - The most effective way to identify project deliverables, and the \n    required tasks, is to facilitate the core team in creating a \n    graphical Work Breakdown Structure W B S, using post-it notes. \n\n  - The tasks to produce a deliverable have a beginning and an \n    end, rolling up the dates for all the project's deliverables \n    becomes the project's estimated schedule.\n\n  - Completion criteria for this step is to have identified the project's \n    deliverables, and the key tasks for producing each deliverable. \n\n  - Create a graphical view or hierarchical outline of what the \n    project will deliver.\n\n  - Develop the project Work Breakdown Structure by identifying \n    the project’s deliverables, sub-deliverables, tasks & or work \n    packages.\n\n  - Using this simple approach will create clarity   \n  - The project name goes at the top \n  - The next level contains the Deliverables, i.e. nouns\n  - Sometimes Deliverables are big & need to be broken down into \n    Sub-deliverables, \n  - Sub-deliverables are also things, nouns.  \n  - Deliverables & Sub-deliverables are not necessarily one word \n    nouns, but the label should describe things.  \n  - Some deliverables are easily identified as things, some may be \n    a little more difficult.  \n  - Why is it important to identify the things the project will \n    produce?  Because you can describe a thing in a way that \n    everyone can recognize it when they work on it & implement it.  \n  - Examples; Report, Descriptions, Specifications, Training Plan, \n    Training Material, Agreement, etc.\n  - Projects produce Things that previously didn’t exist or modify \n    existing Things.   \n  - Deliverables & sub-deliverables are created by doing work, \n    work is a task.  \n  - Sometimes multiple tasks are combined into a Work Package & \n    assigned to a resource, department, or sub-contractor.  \n  - Sometimes a Work Package in one project is significant enough \n    that it needs to be managed as a project by the assigned \n    resource, department, or sub-contractor.  In that case you would \n    have a project within a project.\n\nTasks & work packages should start with a verb like create, develop, research, acquire, design, gather, negotiate, etc.\n\nTasks & work packages are what get scheduled\n\nWe strongly recommend not going beyond 3 levels in your Work Breakdown Structure.  Deliverables, Sub-deliverables, & Tasks or Work Packages.  When you add more levels you’ll be adding complexity that will be harder to manage\n\nAll work within the project must be in the WBS.  That includes the work of planning & managing the project.  \n\nProject Management is the first Deliverable for all projects.  Not all projects need all phases of the project process.  A two week project may only need two phases – The Planning Phase of create the WBS, develop the schedule, assign the tasks, & monitor the work & the second phase being Implement & Post-op.plus the deliverables.\n\nHere’s an important rule for managing project scope – If it’s in the WBS it’s in the project\n\nIf it’s not in the WBS it’s not in the project.  Ideas & suggestions that don’t fit the needs for the current project go on a list for possibly being part of the next version or a different project\n",

Requirements \n    can come from multiple groups, such as customers, \n    management, project sponsor, stakeholders, users of the \n    intended solution, groups impacted by the problem and \n    proposed solution, regulators, citizens, local, state, and \n    federal government. \n2. Identify the individuals, departments, or groups that will be most \n    impacted by this project.\n3. Determine if you're comfortable that you have & understand the \n    summary & detailed requirements from these most impacted \n    groups.\n4. If you're not sure you have & understand all the requirements, \n    consider facilitating a focus group of representatives from the \n    most impacted groups to gather and validate their requirements.\n\n\nThe elements to discuss & gather from each group include:\n  - Their view of the project’s goals\n  - Their needs & wants\n  - Current business state\n  - Key assumptions\n  - Technology requirements\n  - Quality requirements\n  - Organizational considerations. \n\n \n\n    What are their assumptions?\n    Why do they believe that…?\n    It appears that they are assuming…?\n    What are the assumptions that appear to be driving resistance within the groups?\n    What are the assumptions that appear to be driving support within the groups?\n    What’s the risk of proceeding with certain assumptions?\n    What are the group’s requirements and specifications?\n    How will we assess and validate the requirements and specifications?\n    What are the technology requirements and specifications?\n    How will we assess and validate the technology requirements and specifications?\n    What are the quality / performance requirements?\n    How will we assess and validate the quality requirements and specifications?\n    How will we know this item has been completed?\n​\n\nStep seven, Additional Requirements, Depending on the project, initial requirements have already been shared during the first six steps. Additional requirements can come from multiple groups, such as customers, management, project sponsor, stakeholders, users of the intended solution, groups impacted by the problem and proposed solution, regulators, citizens, and local, state, and federal government. Identify the groups that will be providing the summary and detailed requirements for your project. Consider meeting with representatives from the key groups, facilitate a session for gathering the following information, group's goals and objective for the project, their needs and wants, their current state, key assumptions, solution requirements, technology requirements, quality requirements, and organizational considerations.  Ask open ended questions, document the requirements, review each requirement, decide which ones will be met, provide feedback to the groups explaining the results of the meetings, decisions and reasons for the actions to be taken. If you would like more detail for this step, say Project Requirements, When you have sufficient information, continue to the next step by saying, Step Eight.\n\n",

Additional requirements can come from multiple groups, such as customers, management, project sponsor, stakeholders, users of the intended solution, groups impacted by the problem and proposed solution, regulators, citizens, and local, state, and federal government. Identify the groups that will be providing the summary and detailed requirements for your project. Consider meeting with representatives from the key groups, facilitate a session for gathering the following information, group's goals and objective for the project, their needs and wants, their current state, key assumptions, solution requirements, technology requirements, quality requirements, and organizational considerations.  Ask open ended questions, document the requirements, review each requirement, decide which ones will be met, provide feedback to the groups explaining the results of the meetings, decisions and reasons for the actions to be taken. If you would like more detail for this step, say Project Requirements, When you have sufficient information, continue to the next step by saying, Step Eight.\n\n\n",

Describe how the project will be \n  launched. \n\n- Define the teams, at a minimum you'll have a core team, with the \n  members that will be actively involved throughout the entire \n  project. \n\n- Many projects, also require extended teams, that work on \n  specific portions of the project. \n\n- Your project team can be your biggest asset, it can also be your \n  biggest risk. \n\n- Take the time to get to know every team member, and develop \n  effective relationships. \n\n- The more significant the project the more administration will be \n  required and the more you'll want to establish the administration \n  prior to the launch\n\n- It's important to have the project's sponsor and core team \n  actively participate in the launch\n\n- Research confirms that projects with active sponsors are always \n  more successful than projects without sponsors\n\nProject Teams:\n    - How many & what kind of teams will be required?\n    - Who’s the project sponsor & what’s the sponsor’s involvement \n      in the project?\n    - Who are key project stakeholders & what’s their involvement in \n      the project?\n    - Who’s the project manager & team leader for each team or \n      sub-team?\n    - What departments need to be represented on the project core \n      team?\n    - Who are the core team members & what are their roles & \n      responsibilities?\n    - What skills are required on the project core team?\n    - How often & when will project team meetings be held?\n    - Who will be required to participate in project team meetings?\n    - How will project team decisions be made?\n    - How will project team meetings be managed?\n    - What’s the escalation process?\n    - How will project team performance issues be handled?\n    - Who will record & track the schedule, action items & issues?\n    - Who will record assumptions?\n    - What automated tools will be used?\n    - Do team members need any training?\n\nProject Sponsors:\n  - Sponsors will generally be Senior Managers who have ultimate \n    responsibility for the successful completion of Business \n    Initiatives\n  - Sponsor Responsibilities Gives direction to the project\n  - Obtains necessary resources including commitment of people & \n    hours across the organization\n  - Secures management agreements\n  - Provides regular reports to management team\n  - Is committed to ensuring results are achieved\n  - Provides assistance / guidance to project manager\n  - Provides political support\n  - The sponsor will usually be involved in launching the project. \n  - It is recommended that all projects have a sponsor.\n  - The sponsor helps set the project’s direction, goals, & \n    objectives\n\nEvery Project requires a Project Manager who…..\n  - Takes the lead position in the project\n  - Facilitates the project and team process\n  - Collaborates with the team to create and execute the project \n    plan\n  - Monitors and documents the progress of all project work\n  - Reports to the Sponsor on Project Progress\n  - Facilitates & develops reporting updates to the cross-functional \n    Project Management Steering Committee\n\nThe larger, the more complex, the more critical the project the more the project manager needs to be a planner, manager, negotiator, facilitator, & communicator & not a doer.\n\nProject managers get things done.  The difference between effective and less effective project managers is whether the most important things get done.  \n\nWhile it would be great for all the identified work within a project to be completed on time, on budget, & per specifications; sometimes that’s just not feasible.  For that reason it’s important to identify & ensure that the most important or critical work is completed producing the most important or critical deliverables.\n\n​​Project managers ensure predictable results by following a defined process\n   - Develop effective habits\n   - Ask probing open ended questions\n   - Influence required behavior change\n\nWhen selecting the project manager: \n   - Understand the involvement in previous projects\n   - What's the background in project management methods and \n     tools\n   - What's the time required for this project and time availability to \n     meet the requirements.\n   - Understands and able to work with team member styles\n\nWhat Do Project Managers Do?\n1. Defines project goals, objectives, and requirements (with \n    sponsor)\n2. Builds consensus and facilitates conflict resolution\n3. Defines the project scope, WBS, & Network Diagram (if \n    required) \n4. Sets priorities and makes recommendations\n5. Forms and leads the project team & publishes all plans\n6. Ensures completion of all deliverables\n7. Minimize surprises\n8. Recognizes and rewards accomplishments and successes\n9. Provides direct communication with the sponsor\n10. Monitors delivery against all plans and commitments\n11. Coordinates and supports the project team\n12. Identifies & mitigates risk\n13. Controls changes\n14. Focal point for issues, questions, and enhancements\n15. Chairs project team meetings\n16. Facilitates problem resolution\n17. Involved in all project communication\n18. Maintains focus on behavior change required to produce the \n      committed results\n19. Manages activities during each stage\n20. Rewards team performance\n\nThe Bottom Line:\nProject managers get things done, the difference between effective and less effective project managers is whether the most important things get done.\n\n\nTeam Member Responsibilities:\n  - Understand, help develop, and support project direction, business results, & goals\n  - Participate in planning, as needed\n  - Accountable for completing tasks\n  - Support each other and the project manager\n  - Participate in problem resolution\n  - Report status, uncover issues, & communicate\n  - Keep your supervisor / manager informed of your work & time \n    commitments \n  - Participate in all reviews and audits\n\nEstablish Team Operating Procedures to Reduce Conflict:\n  - Define roles and responsibilities\n  - Establish expectations\n  - Define meeting schedules\n  - Describe the meeting process\n  - Identify automated & manual tools\n  - Establish decision making & escalation process\n  - Value individual feedback\n  - Define performance management\n  - Define documentation requirements, process, and \n    responsibilities\n  - Identify team training and development requirements\n\n",

Describe how the project will be \n  launched. \n\n- Define the teams, at a minimum you'll have a core team, with the \n  members that will be actively involved throughout the entire \n  project. \n\n- Many projects, also require extended teams, that work on \n  specific portions of the project. \n\n- Your project team can be your biggest asset, it can also be your \n  biggest risk. \n\n- Take the time to get to know every team member, and develop \n  effective relationships. \n\n- The more significant the project the more administration will be \n  required and the more you'll want to establish the administration \n  prior to the launch\n\n- It's important to have the project's sponsor and core team \n  actively participate in the launch\n\n- Research confirms that projects with active sponsors are always \n  more successful than projects without sponsors\n\nProject Teams:\n    - How many & what kind of teams will be required?\n    - Who’s the project sponsor & what’s the sponsor’s involvement \n      in the project?\n    - Who are key project stakeholders & what’s their involvement in \n      the project?\n    - Who’s the project manager & team leader for each team or \n      sub-team?\n    - What departments need to be represented on the project core \n      team?\n    - Who are the core team members & what are their roles & \n      responsibilities?\n    - What skills are required on the project core team?\n    - How often & when will project team meetings be held?\n    - Who will be required to participate in project team meetings?\n    - How will project team decisions be made?\n    - How will project team meetings be managed?\n    - What’s the escalation process?\n    - How will project team performance issues be handled?\n    - Who will record & track the schedule, action items & issues?\n    - Who will record assumptions?\n    - What automated tools will be used?\n    - Do team members need any training?\n\nProject Sponsors:\n  - Sponsors will generally be Senior Managers who have ultimate \n    responsibility for the successful completion of Business \n    Initiatives\n  - Sponsor Responsibilities Gives direction to the project\n  - Obtains necessary resources including commitment of people & \n    hours across the organization\n  - Secures management agreements\n  - Provides regular reports to management team\n  - Is committed to ensuring results are achieved\n  - Provides assistance / guidance to project manager\n  - Provides political support\n  - The sponsor will usually be involved in launching the project. \n  - It is recommended that all projects have a sponsor.\n  - The sponsor helps set the project’s direction, goals, & \n    objectives\n\nEvery Project requires a Project Manager who…..\n  - Takes the lead position in the project\n  - Facilitates the project and team process\n  - Collaborates with the team to create and execute the project \n    plan\n  - Monitors and documents the progress of all project work\n  - Reports to the Sponsor on Project Progress\n  - Facilitates & develops reporting updates to the cross-functional \n    Project Management Steering Committee\n\nThe larger, the more complex, the more critical the project the more the project manager needs to be a planner, manager, negotiator, facilitator, & communicator & not a doer.\n\nProject managers get things done.  The difference between effective and less effective project managers is whether the most important things get done.  \n\nWhile it would be great for all the identified work within a project to be completed on time, on budget, & per specifications; sometimes that’s just not feasible.  For that reason it’s important to identify & ensure that the most important or critical work is completed producing the most important or critical deliverables.\n\n​​Project managers ensure predictable results by following a defined process\n   - Develop effective habits\n   - Ask probing open ended questions\n   - Influence required behavior change\n\nWhen selecting the project manager: \n   - Understand the involvement in previous projects\n   - What's the background in project management methods and \n     tools\n   - What's the time required for this project and time availability to \n     meet the requirements.\n   - Understands and able to work with team member styles\n\nWhat Do Project Managers Do?\n1. Defines project goals, objectives, and requirements (with \n    sponsor)\n2. Builds consensus and facilitates conflict resolution\n3. Defines the project scope, WBS, & Network Diagram (if \n    required) \n4. Sets priorities and makes recommendations\n5. Forms and leads the project team & publishes all plans\n6. Ensures completion of all deliverables\n7. Minimize surprises\n8. Recognizes and rewards accomplishments and successes\n9. Provides direct communication with the sponsor\n10. Monitors delivery against all plans and commitments\n11. Coordinates and supports the project team\n12. Identifies & mitigates risk\n13. Controls changes\n14. Focal point for issues, questions, and enhancements\n15. Chairs project team meetings\n16. Facilitates problem resolution\n17. Involved in all project communication\n18. Maintains focus on behavior change required to produce the \n      committed results\n19. Manages activities during each stage\n20. Rewards team performance\n\nThe Bottom Line:\nProject managers get things done, the difference between effective and less effective project managers is whether the most important things get done.\n\n\nTeam Member Responsibilities:\n  - Understand, help develop, and support project direction, business results, & goals\n  - Participate in planning, as needed\n  - Accountable for completing tasks\n  - Support each other and the project manager\n  - Participate in problem resolution\n  - Report status, uncover issues, & communicate\n  - Keep your supervisor / manager informed of your work & time \n    commitments \n  - Participate in all reviews and audits\n\nEstablish Team Operating Procedures to Reduce Conflict:\n  - Define roles and responsibilities\n  - Establish expectations\n  - Define meeting schedules\n  - Describe the meeting process\n  - Identify automated & manual tools\n  - Establish decision making & escalation process\n  - Value individual feedback\n  - Define performance management\n  - Define documentation requirements, process, and \n    responsibilities\n  - Identify team training and development requirements\n\n",

The difference between effective and less effective project managers is whether the most important things get done.  \n\nWhile it would be great for all the identified work within a project to be completed on time, on budget, & per specifications; sometimes that’s just not feasible.  For that reason it’s important to identify & ensure that the most important or critical work is completed producing the most important or critical deliverables.\n\n​​Project managers ensure predictable results by following a defined process\n   - Develop effective habits\n   - Ask probing open ended questions\n   - Influence required behavior change\n\nWhen selecting the project manager: \n   - Understand the involvement in previous projects\n   - What's the background in project management methods and \n     tools\n   - What's the time required for this project and time availability to \n     meet the requirements.\n   - Understands and able to work with team member styles\n\nWhat Do Project Managers Do?\n1. Defines project goals, objectives, and requirements (with \n    sponsor)\n2. Builds consensus and facilitates conflict resolution\n3. Defines the project scope, WBS, & Network Diagram (if \n    required) \n4. Sets priorities and makes recommendations\n5. Forms and leads the project team & publishes all plans\n6. Ensures completion of all deliverables\n7. Minimize surprises\n8. Recognizes and rewards accomplishments and successes\n9. Provides direct communication with the sponsor\n10.

Develop, design, initiate, etc, \n\n  - The most effective way to identify project deliverables, and the \n    required tasks, is to facilitate the core team in creating a \n    graphical Work Breakdown Structure W B S, using post-it notes. \n\n  - The tasks to produce a deliverable have a beginning and an \n    end, rolling up the dates for all the project's deliverables \n    becomes the project's estimated schedule.\n\n  - Completion criteria for this step is to have identified the project's \n    deliverables, and the key tasks for producing each deliverable. \n\n  - Create a graphical view or hierarchical outline of what the \n    project will deliver.\n\n  - Develop the project Work Breakdown Structure by identifying \n    the project’s deliverables, sub-deliverables, tasks & or work \n    packages.\n\n  - Using this simple approach will create clarity   \n  - The project name goes at the top \n  - The next level contains the Deliverables, i.e. nouns\n  - Sometimes Deliverables are big & need to be broken down into \n    Sub-deliverables, \n  - Sub-deliverables are also things, nouns.  \n  - Deliverables & Sub-deliverables are not necessarily one word \n    nouns, but the label should describe things.  \n  - Some deliverables are easily identified as things, some may be \n    a little more difficult.  \n  - Why is it important to identify the things the project will \n    produce?  Because you can describe a thing in a way that \n    everyone can recognize it when they work on it & implement it.  \n  - Examples; Report, Descriptions, Specifications, Training Plan, \n    Training Material, Agreement, etc.\n  - Projects produce Things that previously didn’t exist or modify \n    existing Things.   \n  - Deliverables & sub-deliverables are created by doing work, \n    work is a task.  \n  - Sometimes multiple tasks are combined into a Work Package & \n    assigned to a resource, department, or sub-contractor.  \n  - Sometimes a Work Package in one project is significant enough \n    that it needs to be managed as a project by the assigned \n    resource, department, or sub-contractor.  In that case you would \n    have a project within a project.\n\nTasks & work packages should start with a verb like create, develop, research, acquire, design, gather, negotiate, etc.\n\nTasks & work packages are what get scheduled\n\nWe strongly recommend not going beyond 3 levels in your Work Breakdown Structure.  Deliverables, Sub-deliverables, & Tasks or Work Packages.  When you add more levels you’ll be adding complexity that will be harder to manage\n\nAll work within the project must be in the WBS.  That includes the work of planning & managing the project.  \n\nProject Management is the first Deliverable for all projects.  Not all projects need all phases of the project process.  A two week project may only need two phases – The Planning Phase of create the WBS, develop the schedule, assign the tasks, & monitor the work & the second phase being Implement & Post-op.plus the deliverables.\n\nHere’s an important rule for managing project scope – If it’s in the WBS it’s in the project\n\nIf it’s not in the WBS it’s not in the project.  Ideas & suggestions that don’t fit the needs for the current project go on a list for possibly being part of the next version or a different project\n",

Additional requirements can come from multiple groups, such as customers, management, project sponsor, stakeholders, users of the intended solution, groups impacted by the problem and proposed solution, regulators, citizens, and local, state, and federal government. Identify the groups that will be providing the summary and detailed requirements for your project. Consider meeting with representatives from the key groups, facilitate a session for gathering the following information, group's goals and objective for the project, their needs and wants, their current state, key assumptions, solution requirements, technology requirements, quality requirements, and organizational considerations.  Ask open ended questions, document the requirements, review each requirement, decide which ones will be met, provide feedback to the groups explaining the results of the meetings, decisions and reasons for the actions to be taken. If you would like more detail for this step, say Project Requirements, When you have sufficient information, continue to the next step by saying, Step Eight.\n\n\n",

      "help": "Minimum Template:\n\nWhen and Why To Use - After becoming familiar with the Basic template use this one when your project has few or no unknowns and less planning would be appropriate.  \n\nHow To Use - It's a quick starting point, not a total solution.  Modify and tailor as you go, try some of the other templates, and create your own templates as you progress.\n\nProject Plan - The Minimum template has 6 recommended work packages for creating the project plan. Your project may require more or less, starting with these 6 will help you determine if you need more. Delete the ones you don't need & add others as required. \n\nDeliverable # 1 - n - Projects create deliverables that currently don't exist, or they modify existing deliverables. The sooner you can identify your project's deliverables the better. The specific title for your deliverables may change as you gain clarity, expect an iterative process. Creating your project plan will help identify the deliverables, identifying potential deliverables will help clarify the project plan. Always consider if you need to include communication, training, and coaching.\n\nWork Packages - Work packages create the deliverables, they may or may not contain tasks. Developing the habit of starting a work package with a verb provides focus on action, doing, i.e the work.\n\nQuestions - When you add a work package it will automatically have a few common questions. Add additional questions tailored for the specific work package. As you select \"Yes\" the percentage of Yes is calculated against the total number of questions and displayed on the work package bar, alongside the work package, and rolled up to the project summary. Write questions you add so that the desired answer is Yes. As you complete a work package delete the questions you've answered \"No\", so the percentage becomes 100%.\n\nNotes - While doing a work package record key information in notes Copy & paste notes into emails and other documents to share as appropriate.\n\nGuidance - The project plan deliverable and work packages have best practice guidance already entered. Enter your own guidance to create a tailored template for your team and company. Encourage your team to check the guidance for their assigned work. \n\nTasks - (TBD) Select the Tasks button on the work package status bar to enter the tasks for a work package. Entering tasks can clarify the detailed work required when it may not be understood, only enter what's necessary.\n",

Describe how the project will be \n  launched. \n\n- Define the teams, at a minimum you'll have a core team, with the \n  members that will be actively involved throughout the entire \n  project. \n\n- Many projects, also require extended teams, that work on \n  specific portions of the project. \n\n- Your project team can be your biggest asset, it can also be your \n  biggest risk. \n\n- Take the time to get to know every team member, and develop \n  effective relationships. \n\n- The more significant the project the more administration will be \n  required and the more you'll want to establish the administration \n  prior to the launch\n\n- It's important to have the project's sponsor and core team \n  actively participate in the launch\n\n- Research confirms that projects with active sponsors are always \n  more successful than projects without sponsors\n\nProject Teams:\n    - How many & what kind of teams will be required?\n    - Who’s the project sponsor & what’s the sponsor’s involvement \n      in the project?\n    - Who are key project stakeholders & what’s their involvement in \n      the project?\n    - Who’s the project manager & team leader for each team or \n      sub-team?\n    - What departments need to be represented on the project core \n      team?\n    - Who are the core team members & what are their roles & \n      responsibilities?\n    - What skills are required on the project core team?\n    - How often & when will project team meetings be held?\n    - Who will be required to participate in project team meetings?\n    - How will project team decisions be made?\n    - How will project team meetings be managed?\n    - What’s the escalation process?\n    - How will project team performance issues be handled?\n    - Who will record & track the schedule, action items & issues?\n    - Who will record assumptions?\n    - What automated tools will be used?\n    - Do team members need any training?\n\nProject Sponsors:\n  - Sponsors will generally be Senior Managers who have ultimate \n    responsibility for the successful completion of Business \n    Initiatives\n  - Sponsor Responsibilities Gives direction to the project\n  - Obtains necessary resources including commitment of people & \n    hours across the organization\n  - Secures management agreements\n  - Provides regular reports to management team\n  - Is committed to ensuring results are achieved\n  - Provides assistance / guidance to project manager\n  - Provides political support\n  - The sponsor will usually be involved in launching the project. \n  - It is recommended that all projects have a sponsor.\n  - The sponsor helps set the project’s direction, goals, & \n    objectives\n\nEvery Project requires a Project Manager who…..\n  - Takes the lead position in the project\n  - Facilitates the project and team process\n  - Collaborates with the team to create and execute the project \n    plan\n  - Monitors and documents the progress of all project work\n  - Reports to the Sponsor on Project Progress\n  - Facilitates & develops reporting updates to the cross-functional \n    Project Management Steering Committee\n\nThe larger, the more complex, the more critical the project the more the project manager needs to be a planner, manager, negotiator, facilitator, & communicator & not a doer.\n\nProject managers get things done.  The difference between effective and less effective project managers is whether the most important things get done.  \n\nWhile it would be great for all the identified work within a project to be completed on time, on budget, & per specifications; sometimes that’s just not feasible.  For that reason it’s important to identify & ensure that the most important or critical work is completed producing the most important or critical deliverables.\n\n​​Project managers ensure predictable results by following a defined process\n   - Develop effective habits\n   - Ask probing open ended questions\n   - Influence required behavior change\n\nWhen selecting the project manager: \n   - Understand the involvement in previous projects\n   - What's the background in project management methods and \n     tools\n   - What's the time required for this project and time availability to \n     meet the requirements.\n   - Understands and able to work with team member styles\n\nWhat Do Project Managers Do?\n1. Defines project goals, objectives, and requirements (with \n    sponsor)\n2. Builds consensus and facilitates conflict resolution\n3. Defines the project scope, WBS, & Network Diagram (if \n    required) \n4. Sets priorities and makes recommendations\n5. Forms and leads the project team & publishes all plans\n6. Ensures completion of all deliverables\n7. Minimize surprises\n8. Recognizes and rewards accomplishments and successes\n9. Provides direct communication with the sponsor\n10. Monitors delivery against all plans and commitments\n11. Coordinates and supports the project team\n12. Identifies & mitigates risk\n13. Controls changes\n14. Focal point for issues, questions, and enhancements\n15. Chairs project team meetings\n16. Facilitates problem resolution\n17. Involved in all project communication\n18. Maintains focus on behavior change required to produce the \n      committed results\n19. Manages activities during each stage\n20. Rewards team performance\n\nThe Bottom Line:\nProject managers get things done, the difference between effective and less effective project managers is whether the most important things get done.\n\n\nTeam Member Responsibilities:\n  - Understand, help develop, and support project direction, business results, & goals\n  - Participate in planning, as needed\n  - Accountable for completing tasks\n  - Support each other and the project manager\n  - Participate in problem resolution\n  - Report status, uncover issues, & communicate\n  - Keep your supervisor / manager informed of your work & time \n    commitments \n  - Participate in all reviews and audits\n\nEstablish Team Operating Procedures to Reduce Conflict:\n  - Define roles and responsibilities\n  - Establish expectations\n  - Define meeting schedules\n  - Describe the meeting process\n  - Identify automated & manual tools\n  - Establish decision making & escalation process\n  - Value individual feedback\n  - Define performance management\n  - Define documentation requirements, process, and \n    responsibilities\n  - Identify team training and development requirements\n\n"

Develop, design, initiate, etc, \n\n  - The most effective way to identify project deliverables, and the \n    required tasks, is to facilitate the core team in creating a \n    graphical Work Breakdown Structure W B S, using post-it notes. \n\n  - The tasks to produce a deliverable have a beginning and an \n    end, rolling up the dates for all the project's deliverables \n    becomes the project's estimated schedule.\n\n  - Completion criteria for this step is to have identified the project's \n    deliverables, and the key tasks for producing each deliverable. \n\n  - Create a graphical view or hierarchical outline of what the \n    project will deliver.\n\n  - Develop the project Work Breakdown Structure by identifying \n    the project’s deliverables, sub-deliverables, tasks & or work \n    packages.\n\n  - Using this simple approach will create clarity   \n  - The project name goes at the top \n  - The next level contains the Deliverables, i.e. nouns\n  - Sometimes Deliverables are big & need to be broken down into \n    Sub-deliverables, \n  - Sub-deliverables are also things, nouns.  \n  - Deliverables & Sub-deliverables are not necessarily one word \n    nouns, but the label should describe things.  \n  - Some deliverables are easily identified as things, some may be \n    a little more difficult.  \n  - Why is it important to identify the things the project will \n    produce?  Because you can describe a thing in a way that \n    everyone can recognize it when they work on it & implement it.  \n  - Examples; Report, Descriptions, Specifications, Training Plan, \n    Training Material, Agreement, etc.\n  - Projects produce Things that previously didn’t exist or modify \n    existing Things.   \n  - Deliverables & sub-deliverables are created by doing work, \n    work is a task.  \n  - Sometimes multiple tasks are combined into a Work Package & \n    assigned to a resource, department, or sub-contractor.  \n  - Sometimes a Work Package in one project is significant enough \n    that it needs to be managed as a project by the assigned \n    resource, department, or sub-contractor.  In that case you would \n    have a project within a project.\n\nTasks & work packages should start with a verb like create, develop, research, acquire, design, gather, negotiate, etc.\n\nTasks & work packages are what get scheduled\n\nWe strongly recommend not going beyond 3 levels in your Work Breakdown Structure.  Deliverables, Sub-deliverables, & Tasks or Work Packages.  When you add more levels you’ll be adding complexity that will be harder to manage\n\nAll work within the project must be in the WBS.  That includes the work of planning & managing the project.  \n\nProject Management is the first Deliverable for all projects.  Not all projects need all phases of the project process.  A two week project may only need two phases – The Planning Phase of create the WBS, develop the schedule, assign the tasks, & monitor the work & the second phase being Implement & Post-op.plus the deliverables.\n\nHere’s an important rule for managing project scope – If it’s in the WBS it’s in the project\n\nIf it’s not in the WBS it’s not in the project.  Ideas & suggestions that don’t fit the needs for the current project go on a list for possibly being part of the next version or a different project\n",

Knowing if a similar project was done before and how it went can provide insight into what went well and what didn't.  Previous successes can be cloned or leveraged?  Being aware of who was involved in identifying the need for the project can provide insight into the degree and depth of problem solving or vetting that occured.  Knowing if a specific metric or goal will need to be met typically signifies the business impact and importance of the project.  When the business problem hasn't been defined prior to launching a project the project manager and team will need to facilitate gaining clarity otherwize conflict will typically develop.  Knowing if this project is part of a braoder initiative or strategy is an indication of its potential imprortance to the organization.\n\nGather background information that's available and determine if you're comfortable moving forward.  Sometimes you may need to move forward regardless of the information avaiable and continue doing research while starting the project.  \n\nProjects solve or minimize problems and or create new opportunities.  Having a clear description of the problem or problems to be addressed will create focus.  Ensuring that all team members have a common understanding of the problem will enable project success.  If key individuals don't agree with the problem, they won't agree with the proposed solution.  The key question to automatically ask whenever a new idea surfaces is: What problem will this solve?  Recognize that how the problem is defined will determine the direction of the proposed solution.\n​\nProject background can be the result of senior management planning, customer requirements, employee suggestions, responses to daily problems, suggestions for leveraging new technology, etc.  Recognize that the presenting problem / idea can change as you apply the project management process,  How ideas and problems are handled are determined by the organization's culture.  An open & collaborative culture will welcome new ideas & have a way to process the idea while closed / top-down organizations may limit & even discourage new ideas.\n\nRecord and share key background information with your core project team.\n",

Describe how the project will be launched. \n- Define the teams, at a minimum you'll have a core team, with the members that will be actively involved throughout the entire project. \n- Many projects, also require extended teams, that work on specific portions of the project. \n- Your project team can be your biggest asset, it can also be your biggest risk. \n- Take the time to get to know every team member, and develop effective relationships. \n- The more significant the project the more administration will be required and the more you'll want to establish the administration prior to the launch\n- It's important to have the project's sponsor and core team actively participate in the launch\n- Research confirms that projects with active sponsors are always more successful than projects without sponsors\n\nProject Teams:\n    How many & what kind of teams will be required?\n    Who’s the project sponsor & what’s the sponsor’s involvement in the project?\n    Who are key project stakeholders & what’s their involvement in the project?\n    Who’s the project manager & team leader for each team or sub-team?\n    What departments need to be represented on the project core team?\n    Who are the core team members & what are their roles & responsibilities?\n    What skills are required on the project core team?\n    How often & when will project team meetings be held?\n    Who will be required to participate in project team meetings?\n    How will project team decisions be made?\n    How will project team meetings be managed?\n    What’s the escalation process?\n    How will project team performance issues be handled?\n    Who will record & track the schedule, action items & issues?\n    Who will record assumptions?\n    What automated tools will be used?\n    Do team members need any training?\n\nProject Sponsors:\n  - Sponsors will generally be Senior Managers who have ultimate responsibility for the successful completion of Business Initiatives….. \n  - Sponsor Responsibilities Gives direction to the project\n  - Obtains necessary resources including commitment of people & hours across the organization\n  - Secures management agreements\n  - Provides regular reports to management team\n  - Is committed to ensuring results are achieved\n  - Provides assistance / guidance to project manager\n  - Provides political support\n  - Sponsors will generally be Senior Managers who have ultimate responsibility for the successful completion of the project.\n  - The sponsor will usually be involved in launching the project. \n  - It is recommended that all projects have a sponsor.\n  - The sponsor helps set the project’s direction, goals, & objectives\n\nEvery Project requires a Project Manager who…..\n  - Takes the lead position in the project\n  - Facilitates the project and team process\n  - Collaborates with the team to create and execute the project plan\n  - Monitors and documents the progress of all project work\n  - Reports to the Sponsor on Project Progress\n  - Facilitates & develops reporting updates to the cross-functional Project Management Steering Committee\n\nThe larger, the more complex, the more critical the project the more the project manager needs to be a planner, manager, negotiator, facilitator, & communicator & not a doer.\n\nProject managers get things done.  The difference between effective and less effective project managers is whether the most important things get done.  While it would be great for all the identified work within a project to be completed on time, on budget, & per specifications; sometimes that’s just not feasible.  For that reason it’s important to identify & ensure that the most important or critical work is completed producing the most important or critical deliverables.\n\n​​Project managers ensure predictable results: \n   following a defined process\n   Develop effective habits\n   Ask probing open ended questions\n   Influence required behavior change\n\nWhen selecting the project manager: \n   Understand the involvement in previous projects\n   What's the background in project management methods and tools\n   What's the time required for this project and time availability to meet the requirements.\n   Understands and able to work with team member styles\n\nWhat Do Project Managers Do?\n1. Defines project goals, objectives, and requirements (with sponsor)\n2. Builds consensus and facilitates conflict resolution\n3. Defines the project scope, WBS, & Network Diagram (if required) \n4. Sets priorities and makes recommendations\n5. Forms and leads the project team & publishes all plans\n6. Ensures completion of all deliverables\n7. Minimize surprises\n8. Recognizes and rewards accomplishments and successes\n9. Provides direct communication with the sponsor\n10. Monitors delivery against all plans and commitments\n11. Coordinates and supports the project team\n12. Identifies & mitigates risk\n13. Controls changes\n14. Focal point for issues, questions, and enhancements\n15. Chairs project team meetings\n16. Facilitates problem resolution\n17. Involved in all project communication\n18. Maintains focus on behavior change required to produce the committed results\n19. Manages activities during each stage\n20. Rewards team performance\n\nThe Bottom Line:\nProject managers get things done. \n The difference between effective and less effective project managers is whether the most important things get done.\n\nHow can you ensure predictable results?\n   Follow a defined process\n   Develop effective habits\n   Ask questions\n\nTeam Member Responsibilities:\n  - Understand, help develop, and support project direction, business results, & goals\n  - Participate in planning, as needed\n  - Accountable for completing tasks\n  - Support each other and the project manager\n  - Participate in problem resolution\n  - Report status, uncover issues, & communicate\n  - Keep your supervisor / manager informed of your work & time commitments \n  - Participate in all reviews and audits\n\nEstablish Team Operating Procedures to Reduce Conflict:\n  Define roles and responsibilities\n  Establish expectations\n  Define meeting schedules\n  Describe the meeting process\n  Identify automated & manual tools\n  Establish decision making & escalation process\n  Value individual feedback\n  Define performance management\n  Define documentation requirements, process, and responsibilities\n  Identify team training and development requirements\n  Establish the Stakeholders\n",

Include a description of any market and / or internal conditions and dynamics that might affect the project, as well as any prior attempts to address the underlying business problem.  The described problem determines your approach.\n\nWhat's the project's purpose?\n   What’s the business problem / opportunity?\n   “If we don’t agree on the problem we won’t agree on the solution.”\n   Define the proposed solution\n   Develop goals & objectives\n   Define measurable business results\n   Identify proposed deliverables\n   Record & validate assumptions\n   Define & share the project process\n   Describe what the project is expected to produce, create, or do. \n   Describe the future state, what it will look and feel like, what will be in place\n   Create goals and or objectives that are measurable.\n   Define and quantify the tangible business results that this project is expected to produce (example; increased revenue, decreased expenses, increased market share, \n   increased customer satisfaction, etc.)\n   Define the key factors that will be used to determine and measure project success from the users or customer’s perspective and describe what the organization stands \n   to gain (or not lose) by implementing the project.\n\nBusiness Problem & Opportunity: Describe the business problem & opportunity the project is intended to address.  Include a description of any market and / or internal conditions and dynamics that might affect consideration of the project, as well as any prior attempts to address the underlying business problem.  The described problem determines your approach.\n\nCritical Success Factors: Define the key factors that will be used to determine and measure project success from the user's or customer’s perspective and describe what the organization stands to gain (or not lose) by implementing the project.\n\nBrainstorm the presenting / initial idea to determine its scope & the viability of moving forward.  Ideas for projects & action items can come from many places.  They can be the result of senior management planning, customer requirements, employee suggestions, responses to daily problems, suggestions for leveraging new technology, etc., etc., etc.  Recognize that the presenting idea can change as you apply the project management process,  How ideas are handled are determined by the organization's culture.  An open & collaborative culture will welcome new ideas & have a way to process the idea while closed organizations may limit & even discourage new ideas.\n\n​Describe why this project is needed, how it supports the organization’s goals, what problem it will solve, & what the key requirements are.  This is typically preliminary information & may change as you apply the steps in the project management process, gather what’s available, expand & clarify the information as the project progresses.\n\nThe key question to automatically ask whenever a new idea surfaces is: What problem will this solve?  Recognize that how the problem is defined will determine the direction of the proposed solution.\n\nBusiness Problem & Opportunity:\n    What’s been the history?\n    Why are we doing this project?\n    What’s the external need to do the project?\n    What’s the internal need to do the project?\n    How will this project help?\n    What will it produce that we can build on?\n    Have there been previous attempts at doing a similar project?\n    What were the results & learnings of any previous attempts?\n\nGoals & Objectives:\n    What is the proposed business solution?\n    What are the goals of the project?\n    What are the project objectives?\n    What will the project produce?\n    Are the goals and or objectives specific?\n    Are the goals and or objectives measurable?\n    Are the goals and or objectives attainable?\n    Are the goals and or objectives realistic?\n    Are the goals and or objectives time based?\n\nMeasurable Business Results:\n    What business metrics will be impacted or affected?\n    If the project is successful, what are the business results that will be realized?\n    How will the expected results be monitored and tracked?\n    What will happen if the results are not as expected?\n    Are there any new metrics that need to be established or tracked?\n    What will the intangible results or by-products be?\n\nCritical Success Factors:\n    What will determine project success?\n    How will project success me measured?\n    Why should senior management approve this project?\n    What will the people or impacted groups experience as benefits?\n    What will the intangible results or by-products be?\n    How will we know this deliverable was completed?\n ",

              "help": "Define the Solution Deliverables:\n\n  - This step is the heart of your project.\n  - Projects produce, create, and implement deliverables. \n  - A deliverable is a thing, and should sound like a noun. \n  - We create deliverables by doing work, or tasks. \n  - Tasks start with a verb. Develop, design, initiate, etc, The most effective way to identify project deliverables, and the required tasks, is to facilitate the core team in creating a graphical Work Breakdown Structure W B S, using post-it notes. The tasks to produce a deliverable have a beginning and an end, rolling up the dates for all the project's deliverables becomes the project's estimated schedule. Completion criteria for this step is to have identified the project's deliverables, and the key tasks for producing each deliverable. If you would like more detail for this step, say Project Deliverables, When you have sufficient information, continue to the next step by saying, Step Six. (Changed 7-30-19, Not Uploaded)\n\nCreate a graphical view or hierarchical outline of what the project will deliver.  Develop the project Work Breakdown Structure by identifying the project’s deliverables, sub-deliverables, tasks & or work packages.  View the WBS video\n\n Using this simple approach will create clarity   The project name goes at the top   The next level contains the Deliverables   A Deliverable is a thing, it should sound like a noun\n\nSometimes Deliverables are big & need to be broken down into Sub-deliverables,   Sub-deliverables are also things, nouns.  Deliverables & Sub-deliverables are not necessarily one word nouns, but the label should sound like things.  Some deliverables are easily identified as things, some may be a little more difficult.  Why is it important to identify the things the project will produce?  Because you can describe a thing in a way that everyone can recognize it when they work on it & implement it.  Examples; Report, Descriptions, Specifications, Training Plan, Training Material, Agreement, etc.\n\nProjects produce Things that previously didn’t exist or modify existing Things.   Deliverables & sub-deliverables are created by doing work, work is a task.  Sometimes multiple tasks are combined into a Work Package & assigned to a resource, department, or sub-contractor.  Sometimes a Work Package in one project is significant enough that it needs to be managed as a project by the assigned resource, department, or sub-contractor.  In that case you would have a project within a project.\n\nTasks & work packages should start with a verb like create, develop, research, acquire, design, gather, negotiate, etc.   Tasks & work packages are what get scheduled\n\nWe strongly recommend not going beyond 3 levels in your Work Breakdown Structure.  Deliverables, Sub-deliverables, & Tasks or Work Packages.  When you add more levels you’ll be adding complexity that will be harder to manage\n\nAll work within the project must be in the WBS.  That includes the work of planning & managing the project.  Project Management is the first Deliverable for all projects.  Not all projects need all six phases of the project process.  A two week project may only need two phases – The Planning Phase of create the WBS, develop the schedule, assign the tasks, & monitor the work & the second phase being Post-op.  Then identify & breakdown the solution deliverables.\n\nHere’s an important rule for managing project scope – If it’s in the WBS it’s in the project\n\nIf it’s not in the WBS it’s not in the project.  Ideas & suggestions that don’t fit the needs for the current project go on a list for possibly being part of the next version or a different project\n",

Additional requirements can come from multiple groups, such as customers, management, project sponsor, stakeholders, users of the intended solution, groups impacted by the problem and proposed solution, regulators, citizens, and local, state, and federal government. Identify the groups that will be providing the summary and detailed requirements for your project. Consider meeting with representatives from the key groups, facilitate a session for gathering the following information, group's goals and objective for the project, their needs and wants, their current state, key assumptions, solution requirements, technology requirements, quality requirements, and organizational considerations.  Ask open ended questions, document the requirements, review each requirement, decide which ones will be met, provide feedback to the groups explaining the results of the meetings, decisions and reasons for the actions to be taken. If you would like more detail for this step, say Project Requirements, When you have sufficient information, continue to the next step by saying, Step Eight.\n\n\n",

              "help": "Define Dependencies:\n\n  - Identifying, tracking, & continuously updating the dependency between tasks and/or work packages is a key part of any project.  \n  - The sequence or dependency of the work i.e. knowing what comes before & what follows will determine the project’s schedule.  \n  - The more work that can be done in parallel the shorter the project, the more work in a linear sequence the longer the project.  \n  - There are two kinds of time associated with project tasks, duration and work effort.\n  - Work Effort – The amount of time required to perform a task for all resources involved in the task (work effort drives the labor cost)\n  - Duration – The available calendar time required to perform the task. (duration drives the project schedule)\n  - The Critical Path: The path with the longest duration path, it Is the project schedule.\n  - The crirical path can change as the work changes throughout a project, and it needs to be monitored & managed\n  - The Network Diagram produces a calculated schedule based on data.\n  - A particular task may require 4 hours of work effort, 2 hours each for 2 resources, but it may be spread out over 8 calendar days\n  - The dependency of the work within small projects can be easily identified.  \n  - The tool for identifying dependency in medium to large project is the Network Diagram.  \n  - Determining task dependency is a skill every project manager & team member needs.  \n  -​ The most effective way to create the network diagram for a project is to facilitate the core team in building it using post-it notes\n\nJust as we recommended creating the Work Breakdown Structure with post-it notes we also recommend creating a graphical Network Diagram with post-it notes before entering the information into any software\n\nThe graphical Network Diagram is used to identify task sequence & dependency\n  - Not all projects need a graphical Network Diagram.\n  - Creating & maintaining a graphical Network Diagram takes time, however it produces clarity,  engagement, commitment, & a calculated schedule\n  - All projects need task sequence & dependency\n  - Sometimes a Network Diagram may only be needed to clarify a portion of a project\n\nGraphical Network Diagram is needed when:\n  - The project is Large & Complex\n  - It’s critical to the organization\n  - There are specific schedule constraints\n  - Specific cost constraints\n  - Specific quality requirements\n  - Limited resources\n  - Differences of opinion regarding task sequence & dependency\n\nThe Network Diagram:\n  - Put sufficient flipchart paper landscape on a flat wall surface . \n  - By positioning the post-its on flipchart paper you’ll be able to roll up the flipchart paper & move your diagram as your team continues to work on it.\n  - Overlap the pages so that when you connect the tasks you’ll be able to draw lines across the pages.\n  - Initially just get all tasks & work packages up so you can see what you have, identifying the specific dependencies will unfold as you follow the recommended steps.\n  - This is an iterative process\n  - The Network Diagram identifies the critical path.  The Critical Path in project management terms is not necessarily the English definition of the word critical\n  - You’ll be brainstorming what comes before & what comes after each task or work package & inserting the connecting lines\n  - As you do this leave space between each item so you have room for the lines\n  - Building the network diagram will help identify tasks or work packages that may need to be added or modified\n  - As you create the network ignore any predefined schedule assumptions or requirements.  Creating the schedule will be the next step.\n  - Ideally you would want the person or persons who will be doing or managing the work participating either as you create the network or validating it later. \n\nBuilding the Network Diagram:\n    1. Record all Tasks and/or Work Packages on Post-it notes\n    2. Include Start Project on the left & End Project on the right\n    3. Initially position Tasks and/or Work Packages in rough relative sequence\n    4. Add significant milestones to identify progress, milestones = 0 duration & effort\n    5. Connect all Tasks and/or Work Packages validated by the owners\n    6. Brainstorm duration & work effort with the owners using a consistent metric\n    7. Identify the longest duration path, that's the Critical Path\n    8. Add the longest / Critical Path to determine the project’s end date\n    9. Add the work effort to determine the total labor required\n\n  - For critical projects do this work for as long as is comfortable, 1 – 2 hours & come back to it at another time. \n  - If you have access to project management software that includes dependencies you can now enter your information into the software & let it calculate the critical path.\n  - Whether you calculate it manually or have software do it, by highlighting the critical path in red on your flipchart paper you’ll have a tool to do what-if analysis that can    \n    otherwise be cumbersome in most project management software.\n  - When project management software that includes dependencies determines your schedule it will use the project start date, the working days & hours for each \n    individual resource & any non-working or holidays that have been entered.\n  - This is typically where the novice user of the software can become confused & feel like the software has a mind of its own.\n  - Defaults in the software may be set that appear to cause surprises.\n  - Use the simplest approach that will meet your needs.  If you’re not familiar with the software you can always continue using the manual post-it approach.\n  - For critical projects invite people who were not part of creating the network to listen as you walk through & explain each task & work package to help validate the \n    sequence & the completeness of your plan.\n  - It’s typical for project customers & sponsors to set completion targets prior to allowing the project team to do the appropriate planning, they want it done fast.  \n  - Prior to identifying & validating task dependency project schedules are at best an estimate or a guess.  \n  - If the Network Diagram’s calculated schedule is longer than required you now have the data to “Crash” or reduce project time. \n  - Maintaining the network diagram every time there is a change can add overhead to managing the project.  \n  - For some projects it can be absolutely critical that each change in duration & dependency is monitored & managed.\n  - For many projects creating the network at the beginning of the project to understand & define dependency and initial duration but not maintain the network may be \n    enough.  This is especially true when dependency doesn’t change but only duration changes.  In these cases a manual process of hand shakes between task or work \n    package owners with oversight from the project manager can be established to monitor & respond to the duration changes.\n"

              "help": "Launch the Project and Establish the Teams:\n\n- This is the official start for most business projects \n\n- Describe how the project will be launched, who will be involved in \n  launching it, and what information will be made available or has \n  been made available for the launch.\n\n- Verify you have all required background information and are \n  ready to launch the project. \n\n- Projects started in haste without adequate information typically \n  become problem projects. Describe how the project will be \n  launched. \n\n- Define the teams, at a minimum you'll have a core team, with the \n  members that will be actively involved throughout the entire \n  project. \n\n- Many projects, also require extended teams, that work on \n  specific portions of the project. \n\n- Your project team can be your biggest asset, it can also be your \n  biggest risk. \n\n- Take the time to get to know every team member, and develop \n  effective relationships. \n\n- The more significant the project the more administration will be \n  required and the more you'll want to establish the administration \n  prior to the launch\n\n- It's important to have the project's sponsor and core team \n  actively participate in the launch\n\n- Research confirms that projects with active sponsors are always \n  more successful than projects without sponsors\n\nProject Teams:\n    - How many & what kind of teams will be required?\n    - Who’s the project sponsor & what’s the sponsor’s involvement \n      in the project?\n    - Who are key project stakeholders & what’s their involvement in \n      the project?\n    - Who’s the project manager & team leader for each team or \n      sub-team?\n    - What departments need to be represented on the project core \n      team?\n    - Who are the core team members & what are their roles & \n      responsibilities?\n    - What skills are required on the project core team?\n    - How often & when will project team meetings be held?\n    - Who will be required to participate in project team meetings?\n    - How will project team decisions be made?\n    - How will project team meetings be managed?\n    - What’s the escalation process?\n    - How will project team performance issues be handled?\n    - Who will record & track the schedule, action items & issues?\n    - Who will record assumptions?\n    - What automated tools will be used?\n    - Do team members need any training?\n\nProject Sponsors:\n  - Sponsors will generally be Senior Managers who have ultimate \n    responsibility for the successful completion of Business \n    Initiatives\n  - Sponsor Responsibilities Gives direction to the project\n  - Obtains necessary resources including commitment of people & \n    hours across the organization\n  - Secures management agreements\n  - Provides regular reports to management team\n  - Is committed to ensuring results are achieved\n  - Provides assistance / guidance to project manager\n  - Provides political support\n  - The sponsor will usually be involved in launching the project. \n  - It is recommended that all projects have a sponsor.\n  - The sponsor helps set the project’s direction, goals, & \n    objectives\n\nEvery Project requires a Project Manager who…..\n  - Takes the lead position in the project\n  - Facilitates the project and team process\n  - Collaborates with the team to create and execute the project \n    plan\n  - Monitors and documents the progress of all project work\n  - Reports to the Sponsor on Project Progress\n  - Facilitates & develops reporting updates to the cross-functional \n    Project Management Steering Committee\n\nThe larger, the more complex, the more critical the project the more the project manager needs to be a planner, manager, negotiator, facilitator, & communicator & not a doer.\n\nProject managers get things done.  The difference between effective and less effective project managers is whether the most important things get done.  \n\nWhile it would be great for all the identified work within a project to be completed on time, on budget, & per specifications; sometimes that’s just not feasible.  For that reason it’s important to identify & ensure that the most important or critical work is completed producing the most important or critical deliverables.\n\n​​Project managers ensure predictable results by following a defined process\n   - Develop effective habits\n   - Ask probing open ended questions\n   - Influence required behavior change\n\nWhen selecting the project manager: \n   - Understand the involvement in previous projects\n   - What's the background in project management methods and \n     tools\n   - What's the time required for this project and time availability to \n     meet the requirements.\n   - Understands and able to work with team member styles\n\nWhat Do Project Managers Do?\n1. Defines project goals, objectives, and requirements (with \n    sponsor)\n2. Builds consensus and facilitates conflict resolution\n3. Defines the project scope, WBS, & Network Diagram (if \n    required) \n4. Sets priorities and makes recommendations\n5. Forms and leads the project team & publishes all plans\n6. Ensures completion of all deliverables\n7. Minimize surprises\n8. Recognizes and rewards accomplishments and successes\n9. Provides direct communication with the sponsor\n10. Monitors delivery against all plans and commitments\n11. Coordinates and supports the project team\n12. Identifies & mitigates risk\n13. Controls changes\n14. Focal point for issues, questions, and enhancements\n15. Chairs project team meetings\n16. Facilitates problem resolution\n17. Involved in all project communication\n18. Maintains focus on behavior change required to produce the \n      committed results\n19. Manages activities during each stage\n20. Rewards team performance\n\nThe Bottom Line:\nProject managers get things done, the difference between effective and less effective project managers is whether the most important things get done.\n\n\nTeam Member Responsibilities:\n  - Understand, help develop, and support project direction, business results, & goals\n  - Participate in planning, as needed\n  - Accountable for completing tasks\n  - Support each other and the project manager\n  - Participate in problem resolution\n  - Report status, uncover issues, & communicate\n  - Keep your supervisor / manager informed of your work & time \n    commitments \n  - Participate in all reviews and audits\n\nEstablish Team Operating Procedures to Reduce Conflict:\n  - Define roles and responsibilities\n  - Establish expectations\n  - Define meeting schedules\n  - Describe the meeting process\n  - Identify automated & manual tools\n  - Establish decision making & escalation process\n  - Value individual feedback\n  - Define performance management\n  - Define documentation requirements, process, and \n    responsibilities\n  - Identify team training and development requirements\n\n",

Develop, design, initiate, etc, \n\n  - The most effective way to identify project deliverables, and the \n    required tasks, is to facilitate the core team in creating a \n    graphical Work Breakdown Structure W B S, using post-it notes. \n\n  - The tasks to produce a deliverable have a beginning and an \n    end, rolling up the dates for all the project's deliverables \n    becomes the project's estimated schedule.\n\n  - Completion criteria for this step is to have identified the project's \n    deliverables, and the key tasks for producing each deliverable. \n\n  - Create a graphical view or hierarchical outline of what the \n    project will deliver.\n\n  - Develop the project Work Breakdown Structure by identifying \n    the project’s deliverables, sub-deliverables, tasks & or work \n    packages.\n\n  - Using this simple approach will create clarity   \n  - The project name goes at the top \n  - The next level contains the Deliverables, i.e. nouns\n  - Sometimes Deliverables are big & need to be broken down into \n    Sub-deliverables, \n  - Sub-deliverables are also things, nouns.  \n  - Deliverables & Sub-deliverables are not necessarily one word \n    nouns, but the label should describe things.  \n  - Some deliverables are easily identified as things, some may be \n    a little more difficult.  \n  - Why is it important to identify the things the project will \n    produce?  Because you can describe a thing in a way that \n    everyone can recognize it when they work on it & implement it.  \n  - Examples; Report, Descriptions, Specifications, Training Plan, \n    Training Material, Agreement, etc.\n  - Projects produce Things that previously didn’t exist or modify \n    existing Things.   \n  - Deliverables & sub-deliverables are created by doing work, \n    work is a task.  \n  - Sometimes multiple tasks are combined into a Work Package & \n    assigned to a resource, department, or sub-contractor.  \n  - Sometimes a Work Package in one project is significant enough \n    that it needs to be managed as a project by the assigned \n    resource, department, or sub-contractor.  In that case you would \n    have a project within a project.\n\nTasks & work packages should start with a verb like create, develop, research, acquire, design, gather, negotiate, etc.\n\nTasks & work packages are what get scheduled\n\nWe strongly recommend not going beyond 3 levels in your Work Breakdown Structure.  Deliverables, Sub-deliverables, & Tasks or Work Packages.  When you add more levels you’ll be adding complexity that will be harder to manage\n\nAll work within the project must be in the WBS.  That includes the work of planning & managing the project.  \n\nProject Management is the first Deliverable for all projects.  Not all projects need all phases of the project process.  A two week project may only need two phases – The Planning Phase of create the WBS, develop the schedule, assign the tasks, & monitor the work & the second phase being Implement & Post-op.plus the deliverables.\n\nHere’s an important rule for managing project scope – If it’s in the WBS it’s in the project\n\nIf it’s not in the WBS it’s not in the project.  Ideas & suggestions that don’t fit the needs for the current project go on a list for possibly being part of the next version or a different project\n",

If you're not sure you have & understand all the requirements, \n    consider facilitating a focus group of representatives from the \n    most impacted groups to gather and validate their requirements.\n\n\nThe elements to discuss & gather from each group include:\n  - Their view of the project’s goals\n  - Their needs & wants\n  - Current business state\n  - Key assumptions\n  - Technology requirements\n  - Quality requirements\n  - Organizational considerations. \n\n \n\n    What are their assumptions?\n    Why do they believe that…?\n    It appears that they are assuming…?\n    What are the assumptions that appear to be driving resistance within the groups?\n    What are the assumptions that appear to be driving support within the groups?\n    What’s the risk of proceeding with certain assumptions?\n    What are the group’s requirements and specifications?\n    How will we assess and validate the requirements and specifications?\n    What are the technology requirements and specifications?\n    How will we assess and validate the technology requirements and specifications?\n    What are the quality / performance requirements?\n    How will we assess and validate the quality requirements and specifications?\n    How will we know this item has been completed?\n​\n\nStep seven, Additional Requirements, Depending on the project, initial requirements have already been shared during the first six steps. Additional requirements can come from multiple groups, such as customers, management, project sponsor, stakeholders, users of the intended solution, groups impacted by the problem and proposed solution, regulators, citizens, and local, state, and federal government. Identify the groups that will be providing the summary and detailed requirements for your project. Consider meeting with representatives from the key groups, facilitate a session for gathering the following information, group's goals and objective for the project, their needs and wants, their current state, key assumptions, solution requirements, technology requirements, quality requirements, and organizational considerations.  Ask open ended questions, document the requirements, review each requirement, decide which ones will be met, provide feedback to the groups explaining the results of the meetings, decisions and reasons for the actions to be taken. If you would like more detail for this step, say Project Requirements, When you have sufficient information, continue to the next step by saying, Step Eight.\n\n\n",

              "name": "Dependencies",
              "help": "Define Dependencies:\n\n  - Identifying, tracking, & continuously updating the dependency between tasks and/or work packages is a key part of any project.  \n  - The sequence or dependency of the work i.e. knowing what comes before & what follows will determine the project’s schedule.  \n  - The more work that can be done in parallel the shorter the project, the more work in a linear sequence the longer the project.  \n  - There are two kinds of time associated with project tasks, duration and work effort.\n  - Work Effort – The amount of time required to perform a task for all resources involved in the task (work effort drives the labor cost)\n  - Duration – The available calendar time required to perform the task. (duration drives the project schedule)\n  - The Critical Path: The path with the longest duration path, it Is the project schedule.\n  - The crirical path can change as the work changes throughout a project, and it needs to be monitored & managed\n  - The Network Diagram produces a calculated schedule based on data.\n  - A particular task may require 4 hours of work effort, 2 hours each for 2 resources, but it may be spread out over 8 calendar days\n  - The dependency of the work within small projects can be easily identified.  \n  - The tool for identifying dependency in medium to large project is the Network Diagram.  \n  - Determining task dependency is a skill every project manager & team member needs.  \n  -​ The most effective way to create the network diagram for a project is to facilitate the core team in building it using post-it notes\n\nJust as we recommended creating the Work Breakdown Structure with post-it notes we also recommend creating a graphical Network Diagram with post-it notes before entering the information into any software\n\nThe graphical Network Diagram is used to identify task sequence & dependency\n  - Not all projects need a graphical Network Diagram.\n  - Creating & maintaining a graphical Network Diagram takes time, however it produces clarity,  engagement, commitment, & a calculated schedule\n  - All projects need task sequence & dependency\n  - Sometimes a Network Diagram may only be needed to clarify a portion of a project\n\nGraphical Network Diagram is needed when:\n  - The project is Large & Complex\n  - It’s critical to the organization\n  - There are specific schedule constraints\n  - Specific cost constraints\n  - Specific quality requirements\n  - Limited resources\n  - Differences of opinion regarding task sequence & dependency\n\nThe Network Diagram:\n  - Put sufficient flipchart paper landscape on a flat wall surface . \n  - By positioning the post-its on flipchart paper you’ll be able to roll up the flipchart paper & move your diagram as your team continues to work on it.\n  - Overlap the pages so that when you connect the tasks you’ll be able to draw lines across the pages.\n  - Initially just get all tasks & work packages up so you can see what you have, identifying the specific dependencies will unfold as you follow the recommended steps.\n  - This is an iterative process\n  - The Network Diagram identifies the critical path.  The Critical Path in project management terms is not necessarily the English definition of the word critical\n  - You’ll be brainstorming what comes before & what comes after each task or work package & inserting the connecting lines\n  - As you do this leave space between each item so you have room for the lines\n  - Building the network diagram will help identify tasks or work packages that may need to be added or modified\n  - As you create the network ignore any predefined schedule assumptions or requirements.  Creating the schedule will be the next step.\n  - Ideally you would want the person or persons who will be doing or managing the work participating either as you create the network or validating it later. \n\nBuilding the Network Diagram:\n    1. Record all Tasks and/or Work Packages on Post-it notes\n    2. Include Start Project on the left & End Project on the right\n    3. Initially position Tasks and/or Work Packages in rough relative sequence\n    4. Add significant milestones to identify progress, milestones = 0 duration & effort\n    5. Connect all Tasks and/or Work Packages validated by the owners\n    6. Brainstorm duration & work effort with the owners using a consistent metric\n    7. Identify the longest duration path, that's the Critical Path\n    8. Add the longest / Critical Path to determine the project’s end date\n    9. Add the work effort to determine the total labor required\n\n  - For critical projects do this work for as long as is comfortable, 1 – 2 hours & come back to it at another time. \n  - If you have access to project management software that includes dependencies you can now enter your information into the software & let it calculate the critical path.\n  - Whether you calculate it manually or have software do it, by highlighting the critical path in red on your flipchart paper you’ll have a tool to do what-if analysis that can    \n    otherwise be cumbersome in most project management software.\n  - When project management software that includes dependencies determines your schedule it will use the project start date, the working days & hours for each \n    individual resource & any non-working or holidays that have been entered.\n  - This is typically where the novice user of the software can become confused & feel like the software has a mind of its own.\n  - Defaults in the software may be set that appear to cause surprises.\n  - Use the simplest approach that will meet your needs.  If you’re not familiar with the software you can always continue using the manual post-it approach.\n  - For critical projects invite people who were not part of creating the network to listen as you walk through & explain each task & work package to help validate the \n    sequence & the completeness of your plan.\n  - It’s typical for project customers & sponsors to set completion targets prior to allowing the project team to do the appropriate planning, they want it done fast.  \n  - Prior to identifying & validating task dependency project schedules are at best an estimate or a guess.  \n  - If the Network Diagram’s calculated schedule is longer than required you now have the data to “Crash” or reduce project time. \n  - Maintaining the network diagram every time there is a change can add overhead to managing the project.  \n  - For some projects it can be absolutely critical that each change in duration & dependency is monitored & managed.\n  - For many projects creating the network at the beginning of the project to understand & define dependency and initial duration but not maintain the network may be \n    enough.  This is especially true when dependency doesn’t change but only duration changes.  In these cases a manual process of hand shakes between task or work \n    package owners with oversight from the project manager can be established to monitor & respond to the duration changes.\n",

              "help": "Launch the Project and Establish the Teams:\n\n- This is the official start for most business projects \n\n- Describe how the project will be launched, who will be involved in \n  launching it, and what information will be made available or has \n  been made available for the launch.\n\n- Verify you have all required background information and are \n  ready to launch the project. \n\n- Projects started in haste without adequate information typically \n  become problem projects. Describe how the project will be \n  launched. \n\n- Define the teams, at a minimum you'll have a core team, with the \n  members that will be actively involved throughout the entire \n  project. \n\n- Many projects, also require extended teams, that work on \n  specific portions of the project. \n\n- Your project team can be your biggest asset, it can also be your \n  biggest risk. \n\n- Take the time to get to know every team member, and develop \n  effective relationships. \n\n- The more significant the project the more administration will be \n  required and the more you'll want to establish the administration \n  prior to the launch\n\n- It's important to have the project's sponsor and core team \n  actively participate in the launch\n\n- Research confirms that projects with active sponsors are always \n  more successful than projects without sponsors\n\nProject Teams:\n    - How many & what kind of teams will be required?\n    - Who’s the project sponsor & what’s the sponsor’s involvement \n      in the project?\n    - Who are key project stakeholders & what’s their involvement in \n      the project?\n    - Who’s the project manager & team leader for each team or \n      sub-team?\n    - What departments need to be represented on the project core \n      team?\n    - Who are the core team members & what are their roles & \n      responsibilities?\n    - What skills are required on the project core team?\n    - How often & when will project team meetings be held?\n    - Who will be required to participate in project team meetings?\n    - How will project team decisions be made?\n    - How will project team meetings be managed?\n    - What’s the escalation process?\n    - How will project team performance issues be handled?\n    - Who will record & track the schedule, action items & issues?\n    - Who will record assumptions?\n    - What automated tools will be used?\n    - Do team members need any training?\n\nProject Sponsors:\n  - Sponsors will generally be Senior Managers who have ultimate \n    responsibility for the successful completion of Business \n    Initiatives\n  - Sponsor Responsibilities Gives direction to the project\n  - Obtains necessary resources including commitment of people & \n    hours across the organization\n  - Secures management agreements\n  - Provides regular reports to management team\n  - Is committed to ensuring results are achieved\n  - Provides assistance / guidance to project manager\n  - Provides political support\n  - The sponsor will usually be involved in launching the project. \n  - It is recommended that all projects have a sponsor.\n  - The sponsor helps set the project’s direction, goals, & \n    objectives\n\nEvery Project requires a Project Manager who…..\n  - Takes the lead position in the project\n  - Facilitates the project and team process\n  - Collaborates with the team to create and execute the project \n    plan\n  - Monitors and documents the progress of all project work\n  - Reports to the Sponsor on Project Progress\n  - Facilitates & develops reporting updates to the cross-functional \n    Project Management Steering Committee\n\nThe larger, the more complex, the more critical the project the more the project manager needs to be a planner, manager, negotiator, facilitator, & communicator & not a doer.\n\nProject managers get things done.  The difference between effective and less effective project managers is whether the most important things get done.  \n\nWhile it would be great for all the identified work within a project to be completed on time, on budget, & per specifications; sometimes that’s just not feasible.  For that reason it’s important to identify & ensure that the most important or critical work is completed producing the most important or critical deliverables.\n\n​​Project managers ensure predictable results by following a defined process\n   - Develop effective habits\n   - Ask probing open ended questions\n   - Influence required behavior change\n\nWhen selecting the project manager: \n   - Understand the involvement in previous projects\n   - What's the background in project management methods and \n     tools\n   - What's the time required for this project and time availability to \n     meet the requirements.\n   - Understands and able to work with team member styles\n\nWhat Do Project Managers Do?\n1. Defines project goals, objectives, and requirements (with \n    sponsor)\n2. Builds consensus and facilitates conflict resolution\n3. Defines the project scope, WBS, & Network Diagram (if \n    required) \n4. Sets priorities and makes recommendations\n5. Forms and leads the project team & publishes all plans\n6. Ensures completion of all deliverables\n7. Minimize surprises\n8. Recognizes and rewards accomplishments and successes\n9. Provides direct communication with the sponsor\n10. Monitors delivery against all plans and commitments\n11. Coordinates and supports the project team\n12. Identifies & mitigates risk\n13. Controls changes\n14. Focal point for issues, questions, and enhancements\n15. Chairs project team meetings\n16. Facilitates problem resolution\n17. Involved in all project communication\n18. Maintains focus on behavior change required to produce the \n      committed results\n19. Manages activities during each stage\n20. Rewards team performance\n\nThe Bottom Line:\nProject managers get things done, the difference between effective and less effective project managers is whether the most important things get done.\n\n\nTeam Member Responsibilities:\n  - Understand, help develop, and support project direction, business results, & goals\n  - Participate in planning, as needed\n  - Accountable for completing tasks\n  - Support each other and the project manager\n  - Participate in problem resolution\n  - Report status, uncover issues, & communicate\n  - Keep your supervisor / manager informed of your work & time \n    commitments \n  - Participate in all reviews and audits\n\nEstablish Team Operating Procedures to Reduce Conflict:\n  - Define roles and responsibilities\n  - Establish expectations\n  - Define meeting schedules\n  - Describe the meeting process\n  - Identify automated & manual tools\n  - Establish decision making & escalation process\n  - Value individual feedback\n  - Define performance management\n  - Define documentation requirements, process, and \n    responsibilities\n  - Identify team training and development requirements\n\n",

              "help": "Define the Project's Deliverables:\n\n  - This step is the heart of your project.\n\n  - Projects produce, create, and implement deliverables. \n\n  - A deliverable is a thing, and should sound like a noun. \n\n  - We create deliverables by doing work, or tasks. \n\n  - Tasks start with a verb. Develop, design, initiate, etc, \n\n  - The most effective way to identify project deliverables, and the \n    required tasks, is to facilitate the core team in creating a \n    graphical Work Breakdown Structure W B S, using post-it notes. \n\n  - The tasks to produce a deliverable have a beginning and an \n    end, rolling up the dates for all the project's deliverables \n    becomes the project's estimated schedule.\n\n  - Completion criteria for this step is to have identified the project's \n    deliverables, and the key tasks for producing each deliverable. \n\n  - Create a graphical view or hierarchical outline of what the \n    project will deliver.\n\n  - Develop the project Work Breakdown Structure by identifying \n    the project’s deliverables, sub-deliverables, tasks & or work \n    packages.\n\n  - Using this simple approach will create clarity   \n  - The project name goes at the top \n  - The next level contains the Deliverables, i.e. nouns\n  - Sometimes Deliverables are big & need to be broken down into \n    Sub-deliverables, \n  - Sub-deliverables are also things, nouns.  \n  - Deliverables & Sub-deliverables are not necessarily one word \n    nouns, but the label should describe things.  \n  - Some deliverables are easily identified as things, some may be \n    a little more difficult.  \n  - Why is it important to identify the things the project will \n    produce?  Because you can describe a thing in a way that \n    everyone can recognize it when they work on it & implement it.  \n  - Examples; Report, Descriptions, Specifications, Training Plan, \n    Training Material, Agreement, etc.\n  - Projects produce Things that previously didn’t exist or modify \n    existing Things.   \n  - Deliverables & sub-deliverables are created by doing work, \n    work is a task.  \n  - Sometimes multiple tasks are combined into a Work Package & \n    assigned to a resource, department, or sub-contractor.  \n  - Sometimes a Work Package in one project is significant enough \n    that it needs to be managed as a project by the assigned \n    resource, department, or sub-contractor.  In that case you would \n    have a project within a project.\n\nTasks & work packages should start with a verb like create, develop, research, acquire, design, gather, negotiate, etc.\n\nTasks & work packages are what get scheduled\n\nWe strongly recommend not going beyond 3 levels in your Work Breakdown Structure.  Deliverables, Sub-deliverables, & Tasks or Work Packages.  When you add more levels you’ll be adding complexity that will be harder to manage\n\nAll work within the project must be in the WBS.  That includes the work of planning & managing the project.  \n\nProject Management is the first Deliverable for all projects.  Not all projects need all phases of the project process.  A two week project may only need two phases – The Planning Phase of create the WBS, develop the schedule, assign the tasks, & monitor the work & the second phase being Implement & Post-op.plus the deliverables.\n\nHere’s an important rule for managing project scope – If it’s in the WBS it’s in the project\n\nIf it’s not in the WBS it’s not in the project.  Ideas & suggestions that don’t fit the needs for the current project go on a list for possibly being part of the next version or a different project\n",

Provide summary information for management and general stakeholders, and detailed for core team members. \n\n  - The further into a project you go, the more expensive changes \n    in direction become.\n  - Recognize that everything is constantly changing, technology, \n    the business environment, customer needs, employee needs.\n  - Project teams need a way to stay focused on the project's goals \n    that were defined in step 3 while monitoring the change that \n    may impact the project.\n  - The approach we recommend is; do a little work, gain \n    agreement, do a little work, gain agreement, etc.\n  - Preliminary and on-going validation should be a combination of \n    formal and informal reviews, agreements, and approvals\n\nTypes of Reviews:\n  - Project Team\n  - Daily / Weekly Stand-ups\n  - Department\n  - Project Steering Committee / Cross-functional\n  - Customer\n  - Senior Management\n\nDefine the purpose for each type of review\n\nAgree on the information to be presented\n\nIdentify the participants\n\nEstablish the timing\n\nTrack action items and update plans\n\nDescribe the process that will be used to approve the project \nplan\n\nList who will be involved and if it will require a formal or informal approval\n\nDescribe who will need to be involved in reviewing & approving on-going project progress, results, and changes.\n\nDefine how issues that cannot be resolved / decided by the project team will be escalated & how the project sponsor is expected to participate in removing barriers. \n\nReviews / Approvals:\n  - Distribute Information Prior to the Meeting\n  - Define the Presentation Format\n  - Present and Discuss Progress and Results\n  - Encourage Two-way Dialogue, Not Just a One Way Data Dump\n  - Ask For Help When Required\n  - Seek Recommendations\n",

Additional requirements can come from multiple groups, such as customers, management, project sponsor, stakeholders, users of the intended solution, groups impacted by the problem and proposed solution, regulators, citizens, and local, state, and federal government. Identify the groups that will be providing the summary and detailed requirements for your project. Consider meeting with representatives from the key groups, facilitate a session for gathering the following information, group's goals and objective for the project, their needs and wants, their current state, key assumptions, solution requirements, technology requirements, quality requirements, and organizational considerations.  Ask open ended questions, document the requirements, review each requirement, decide which ones will be met, provide feedback to the groups explaining the results of the meetings, decisions and reasons for the actions to be taken.

              "help": "Define Dependencies:\n\n  - Identifying, tracking, & continuously updating the dependency between tasks and/or work packages is a key part of any project.  \n  - The sequence or dependency of the work i.e. knowing what comes before & what follows will determine the project’s schedule.  \n  - The more work that can be done in parallel the shorter the project, the more work in a linear sequence the longer the project.  \n  - There are two kinds of time associated with project tasks, duration and work effort.\n  - Work Effort – The amount of time required to perform a task for all resources involved in the task (work effort drives the labor cost)\n  - Duration – The available calendar time required to perform the task. (duration drives the project schedule)\n  - The Critical Path: The path with the longest duration path, it Is the project schedule.\n  - The crirical path can change as the work changes throughout a project, and it needs to be monitored & managed\n  - The Network Diagram produces a calculated schedule based on data.\n  - A particular task may require 4 hours of work effort, 2 hours each for 2 resources, but it may be spread out over 8 calendar days\n  - The dependency of the work within small projects can be easily identified.  \n  - The tool for identifying dependency in medium to large project is the Network Diagram.  \n  - Determining task dependency is a skill every project manager & team member needs.  \n  -​ The most effective way to create the network diagram for a project is to facilitate the core team in building it using post-it notes\n\nJust as we recommended creating the Work Breakdown Structure with post-it notes we also recommend creating a graphical Network Diagram with post-it notes before entering the information into any software\n\nThe graphical Network Diagram is used to identify task sequence & dependency\n  - Not all projects need a graphical Network Diagram.\n  - Creating & maintaining a graphical Network Diagram takes time, however it produces clarity,  engagement, commitment, & a calculated schedule\n  - All projects need task sequence & dependency\n  - Sometimes a Network Diagram may only be needed to clarify a portion of a project\n\nGraphical Network Diagram is needed when:\n  - The project is Large & Complex\n  - It’s critical to the organization\n  - There are specific schedule constraints\n  - Specific cost constraints\n  - Specific quality requirements\n  - Limited resources\n  - Differences of opinion regarding task sequence & dependency\n\nThe Network Diagram:\n  - Put sufficient flipchart paper landscape on a flat wall surface . \n  - By positioning the post-its on flipchart paper you’ll be able to roll up the flipchart paper & move your diagram as your team continues to work on it.\n  - Overlap the pages so that when you connect the tasks you’ll be able to draw lines across the pages.\n  - Initially just get all tasks & work packages up so you can see what you have, identifying the specific dependencies will unfold as you follow the recommended steps.\n  - This is an iterative process\n  - The Network Diagram identifies the critical path.  The Critical Path in project management terms is not necessarily the English definition of the word critical\n  - You’ll be brainstorming what comes before & what comes after each task or work package & inserting the connecting lines\n  - As you do this leave space between each item so you have room for the lines\n  - Building the network diagram will help identify tasks or work packages that may need to be added or modified\n  - As you create the network ignore any predefined schedule assumptions or requirements.  Creating the schedule will be the next step.\n  - Ideally you would want the person or persons who will be doing or managing the work participating either as you create the network or validating it later. \n\nBuilding the Network Diagram:\n    1. Record all Tasks and/or Work Packages on Post-it notes\n    2. Include Start Project on the left & End Project on the right\n    3. Initially position Tasks and/or Work Packages in rough relative sequence\n    4. Add significant milestones to identify progress, milestones = 0 duration & effort\n    5. Connect all Tasks and/or Work Packages validated by the owners\n    6. Brainstorm duration & work effort with the owners using a consistent metric\n    7. Identify the longest duration path, that's the Critical Path\n    8. Add the longest / Critical Path to determine the project’s end date\n    9. Add the work effort to determine the total labor required\n\n  - For critical projects do this work for as long as is comfortable, 1 – 2 hours & come back to it at another time. \n  - If you have access to project management software that includes dependencies you can now enter your information into the software & let it calculate the critical path.\n  - Whether you calculate it manually or have software do it, by highlighting the critical path in red on your flipchart paper you’ll have a tool to do what-if analysis that can    \n    otherwise be cumbersome in most project management software.\n  - When project management software that includes dependencies determines your schedule it will use the project start date, the working days & hours for each \n    individual resource & any non-working or holidays that have been entered.\n  - This is typically where the novice user of the software can become confused & feel like the software has a mind of its own.\n  - Defaults in the software may be set that appear to cause surprises.\n  - Use the simplest approach that will meet your needs.  If you’re not familiar with the software you can always continue using the manual post-it approach.\n  - For critical projects invite people who were not part of creating the network to listen as you walk through & explain each task & work package to help validate the \n    sequence & the completeness of your plan.\n  - It’s typical for project customers & sponsors to set completion targets prior to allowing the project team to do the appropriate planning, they want it done fast.  \n  - Prior to identifying & validating task dependency project schedules are at best an estimate or a guess.  \n  - If the Network Diagram’s calculated schedule is longer than required you now have the data to “Crash” or reduce project time. \n  - Maintaining the network diagram every time there is a change can add overhead to managing the project.  \n  - For some projects it can be absolutely critical that each change in duration & dependency is monitored & managed.\n  - For many projects creating the network at the beginning of the project to understand & define dependency and initial duration but not maintain the network may be \n    enough.  This is especially true when dependency doesn’t change but only duration changes.  In these cases a manual process of hand shakes between task or work \n    package owners with oversight from the project manager can be established to monitor & respond to the duration changes.\n",

Additional requirements can come from multiple groups, such as customers, management, project sponsor, stakeholders, users of the intended solution, groups impacted by the problem and proposed solution, regulators, citizens, and local, state, and federal government. Identify the groups that will be providing the summary and detailed requirements for your project. Consider meeting with representatives from the key groups, facilitate a session for gathering the following information, group's goals and objective for the project, their needs and wants, their current state, key assumptions, solution requirements, technology requirements, quality requirements, and organizational considerations.  Ask open ended questions, document the requirements, review each requirement, decide which ones will be met, provide feedback to the groups explaining the results of the meetings, decisions and reasons for the actions to be taken. If you would like more detail for this step, say Project Requirements, When you have sufficient information, continue to the next step by saying, Step Eight.\n\n\n",

Additional requirements can come from multiple groups, such as customers, management, project sponsor, stakeholders, users of the intended solution, groups impacted by the problem and proposed solution, regulators, citizens, and local, state, and federal government. Identify the groups that will be providing the summary and detailed requirements for your project. Consider meeting with representatives from the key groups, facilitate a session for gathering the following information, group's goals and objective for the project, their needs and wants, their current state, key assumptions, solution requirements, technology requirements, quality requirements, and organizational considerations.  Ask open ended questions, document the requirements, review each requirement, decide which ones will be met, provide feedback to the groups explaining the results of the meetings, decisions and reasons for the actions to be taken. If you would like more detail for this step, say Project Requirements, When you have sufficient information, continue to the next step by saying, Step Eight.\n\n\n",

Describe how the project will be \n  launched. \n\n- Define the teams, at a minimum you'll have a core team, with the \n  members that will be actively involved throughout the entire \n  project. \n\n- Many projects, also require extended teams, that work on \n  specific portions of the project. \n\n- Your project team can be your biggest asset, it can also be your \n  biggest risk. \n\n- Take the time to get to know every team member, and develop \n  effective relationships. \n\n- The more significant the project the more administration will be \n  required and the more you'll want to establish the administration \n  prior to the launch\n\n- It's important to have the project's sponsor and core team \n  actively participate in the launch\n\n- Research confirms that projects with active sponsors are always \n  more successful than projects without sponsors\n\nProject Teams:\n    - How many & what kind of teams will be required?\n    - Who’s the project sponsor & what’s the sponsor’s involvement \n      in the project?\n    - Who are key project stakeholders & what’s their involvement in \n      the project?\n    - Who’s the project manager & team leader for each team or \n      sub-team?\n    - What departments need to be represented on the project core \n      team?\n    - Who are the core team members & what are their roles & \n      responsibilities?\n    - What skills are required on the project core team?\n    - How often & when will project team meetings be held?\n    - Who will be required to participate in project team meetings?\n    - How will project team decisions be made?\n    - How will project team meetings be managed?\n    - What’s the escalation process?\n    - How will project team performance issues be handled?\n    - Who will record & track the schedule, action items & issues?\n    - Who will record assumptions?\n    - What automated tools will be used?\n    - Do team members need any training?\n\nProject Sponsors:\n  - Sponsors will generally be Senior Managers who have ultimate \n    responsibility for the successful completion of Business \n    Initiatives\n  - Sponsor Responsibilities Gives direction to the project\n  - Obtains necessary resources including commitment of people & \n    hours across the organization\n  - Secures management agreements\n  - Provides regular reports to management team\n  - Is committed to ensuring results are achieved\n  - Provides assistance / guidance to project manager\n  - Provides political support\n  - The sponsor will usually be involved in launching the project. \n  - It is recommended that all projects have a sponsor.\n  - The sponsor helps set the project’s direction, goals, & \n    objectives\n\nEvery Project requires a Project Manager who…..\n  - Takes the lead position in the project\n  - Facilitates the project and team process\n  - Collaborates with the team to create and execute the project \n    plan\n  - Monitors and documents the progress of all project work\n  - Reports to the Sponsor on Project Progress\n  - Facilitates & develops reporting updates to the cross-functional \n    Project Management Steering Committee\n\nThe larger, the more complex, the more critical the project the more the project manager needs to be a planner, manager, negotiator, facilitator, & communicator & not a doer.\n\nProject managers get things done.  The difference between effective and less effective project managers is whether the most important things get done.  \n\nWhile it would be great for all the identified work within a project to be completed on time, on budget, & per specifications; sometimes that’s just not feasible.  For that reason it’s important to identify & ensure that the most important or critical work is completed producing the most important or critical deliverables.\n\n​​Project managers ensure predictable results by following a defined process\n   - Develop effective habits\n   - Ask probing open ended questions\n   - Influence required behavior change\n\nWhen selecting the project manager: \n   - Understand the involvement in previous projects\n   - What's the background in project management methods and \n     tools\n   - What's the time required for this project and time availability to \n     meet the requirements.\n   - Understands and able to work with team member styles\n\nWhat Do Project Managers Do?\n1. Defines project goals, objectives, and requirements (with \n    sponsor)\n2. Builds consensus and facilitates conflict resolution\n3. Defines the project scope, WBS, & Network Diagram (if \n    required) \n4. Sets priorities and makes recommendations\n5. Forms and leads the project team & publishes all plans\n6. Ensures completion of all deliverables\n7. Minimize surprises\n8. Recognizes and rewards accomplishments and successes\n9. Provides direct communication with the sponsor\n10. Monitors delivery against all plans and commitments\n11. Coordinates and supports the project team\n12. Identifies & mitigates risk\n13. Controls changes\n14. Focal point for issues, questions, and enhancements\n15. Chairs project team meetings\n16. Facilitates problem resolution\n17. Involved in all project communication\n18. Maintains focus on behavior change required to produce the \n      committed results\n19. Manages activities during each stage\n20. Rewards team performance\n\nThe Bottom Line:\nProject managers get things done, the difference between effective and less effective project managers is whether the most important things get done.\n\n\nTeam Member Responsibilities:\n  - Understand, help develop, and support project direction, business results, & goals\n  - Participate in planning, as needed\n  - Accountable for completing tasks\n  - Support each other and the project manager\n  - Participate in problem resolution\n  - Report status, uncover issues, & communicate\n  - Keep your supervisor / manager informed of your work & time \n    commitments \n  - Participate in all reviews and audits\n\nEstablish Team Operating Procedures to Reduce Conflict:\n  - Define roles and responsibilities\n  - Establish expectations\n  - Define meeting schedules\n  - Describe the meeting process\n  - Identify automated & manual tools\n  - Establish decision making & escalation process\n  - Value individual feedback\n  - Define performance management\n  - Define documentation requirements, process, and \n    responsibilities\n  - Identify team training and development requirements\n\n",

              "help": "Define the Project's Deliverables:\n\n  - This step is the heart of your project.\n\n  - Projects produce, create, and implement deliverables. \n\n  - A deliverable is a thing, and should sound like a noun. \n\n  - We create deliverables by doing work, or tasks. \n\n  - Tasks start with a verb. Develop, design, initiate, etc, \n\n  - The most effective way to identify project deliverables, and the \n    required tasks, is to facilitate the core team in creating a \n    graphical Work Breakdown Structure W B S, using post-it notes. \n\n  - The tasks to produce a deliverable have a beginning and an \n    end, rolling up the dates for all the project's deliverables \n    becomes the project's estimated schedule.\n\n  - Completion criteria for this step is to have identified the project's \n    deliverables, and the key tasks for producing each deliverable. \n\n  - Create a graphical view or hierarchical outline of what the \n    project will deliver.\n\n  - Develop the project Work Breakdown Structure by identifying \n    the project’s deliverables, sub-deliverables, tasks & or work \n    packages.\n\n  - Using this simple approach will create clarity   \n  - The project name goes at the top \n  - The next level contains the Deliverables, i.e. nouns\n  - Sometimes Deliverables are big & need to be broken down into \n    Sub-deliverables, \n  - Sub-deliverables are also things, nouns.  \n  - Deliverables & Sub-deliverables are not necessarily one word \n    nouns, but the label should describe things.  \n  - Some deliverables are easily identified as things, some may be \n    a little more difficult.  \n  - Why is it important to identify the things the project will \n    produce?  Because you can describe a thing in a way that \n    everyone can recognize it when they work on it & implement it.  \n  - Examples; Report, Descriptions, Specifications, Training Plan, \n    Training Material, Agreement, etc.\n  - Projects produce Things that previously didn’t exist or modify \n    existing Things.   \n  - Deliverables & sub-deliverables are created by doing work, \n    work is a task.  \n  - Sometimes multiple tasks are combined into a Work Package & \n    assigned to a resource, department, or sub-contractor.  \n  - Sometimes a Work Package in one project is significant enough \n    that it needs to be managed as a project by the assigned \n    resource, department, or sub-contractor.  In that case you would \n    have a project within a project.\n\nTasks & work packages should start with a verb like create, develop, research, acquire, design, gather, negotiate, etc.\n\nTasks & work packages are what get scheduled\n\nWe strongly recommend not going beyond 3 levels in your Work Breakdown Structure.  Deliverables, Sub-deliverables, & Tasks or Work Packages.  When you add more levels you’ll be adding complexity that will be harder to manage\n\nAll work within the project must be in the WBS.  That includes the work of planning & managing the project.  \n\nProject Management is the first Deliverable for all projects.  Not all projects need all phases of the project process.  A two week project may only need two phases – The Planning Phase of create the WBS, develop the schedule, assign the tasks, & monitor the work & the second phase being Implement & Post-op.plus the deliverables.\n\nHere’s an important rule for managing project scope – If it’s in the WBS it’s in the project\n\nIf it’s not in the WBS it’s not in the project.  Ideas & suggestions that don’t fit the needs for the current project go on a list for possibly being part of the next version or a different project\n",

Provide summary information for management and general stakeholders, and detailed for core team members. \n\n  - The further into a project you go, the more expensive changes \n    in direction become.\n  - Recognize that everything is constantly changing, technology, \n    the business environment, customer needs, employee needs.\n  - Project teams need a way to stay focused on the project's goals \n    that were defined in step 3 while monitoring the change that \n    may impact the project.\n  - The approach we recommend is; do a little work, gain \n    agreement, do a little work, gain agreement, etc.\n  - Preliminary and on-going validation should be a combination of \n    formal and informal reviews, agreements, and approvals\n\nTypes of Reviews:\n  - Project Team\n  - Daily / Weekly Stand-ups\n  - Department\n  - Project Steering Committee / Cross-functional\n  - Customer\n  - Senior Management\n\nDefine the purpose for each type of review\n\nAgree on the information to be presented\n\nIdentify the participants\n\nEstablish the timing\n\nTrack action items and update plans\n\nDescribe the process that will be used to approve the project \nplan\n\nList who will be involved and if it will require a formal or informal approval\n\nDescribe who will need to be involved in reviewing & approving on-going project progress, results, and changes.\n\nDefine how issues that cannot be resolved / decided by the project team will be escalated & how the project sponsor is expected to participate in removing barriers. \n\nReviews / Approvals:\n  - Distribute Information Prior to the Meeting\n  - Define the Presentation Format\n  - Present and Discuss Progress and Results\n  - Encourage Two-way Dialogue, Not Just a One Way Data Dump\n  - Ask For Help When Required\n  - Seek Recommendations\n",

Additional requirements can come from multiple groups, such as customers, management, project sponsor, stakeholders, users of the intended solution, groups impacted by the problem and proposed solution, regulators, citizens, and local, state, and federal government. Identify the groups that will be providing the summary and detailed requirements for your project. Consider meeting with representatives from the key groups, facilitate a session for gathering the following information, group's goals and objective for the project, their needs and wants, their current state, key assumptions, solution requirements, technology requirements, quality requirements, and organizational considerations.  Ask open ended questions, document the requirements, review each requirement, decide which ones will be met, provide feedback to the groups explaining the results of the meetings, decisions and reasons for the actions to be taken.

              "help": "Define Dependencies:\n\n  - Identifying, tracking, & continuously updating the dependency \n    between tasks and/or work packages is a key part of any \n    project.\n  \n  - The sequence or dependency of the work i.e. knowing what \n    comes before & what follows will determine the project’s \n    schedule.\n\n  - The more work that can be done in parallel the shorter the \n    project, the more work in a linear sequence the longer the \n    project.\n\n  - There are two kinds of time associated with project tasks, \n    duration and work effort.\n\n  - Work Effort – The amount of time required to perform a task for \n    all resources involved in the task (work effort drives the labor \n    cost)\n\n  - Duration – The available calendar time required to perform the \n    task. (duration drives the project schedule)\n\n  - The Critical Path: The path with the longest duration path, it Is \n    the project schedule.\n\n  - The critical path can change as the work changes throughout a \n    project, and it needs to be monitored & managed\n\n  - The Network Diagram produces a calculated schedule based \n    on data.\n\n  - A particular task may require 4 hours of work effort, 2 hours \n    each for 2 resources, but it may be spread out over 8 calendar \n    days\n\n  - The dependency of the work within small projects can be easily \n    identified.  \n\n  - The tool for identifying dependency in medium to large project \n    is the Network Diagram.  \n\n  - Determining task dependency is a skill every project manager & \n    team member needs.  \n\n  -​ The most effective way to create the network diagram for a \n    project is to facilitate the core team in building it using post-it \n    notes\n\nJust as we recommended creating the Work Breakdown Structure with post-it notes we also recommend creating a graphical Network Diagram with post-it notes before entering the information into any software\n\nThe graphical Network Diagram is used to identify task sequence & dependency\n  - Not all projects need a graphical Network Diagram.\n  - Creating & maintaining a graphical Network Diagram takes \n    time, however it produces clarity,  engagement, commitment, & \n    a calculated schedule\n  - All projects need task sequence & dependency\n  - Sometimes a Network Diagram may only be needed to clarify a \n    portion of a project\n\nGraphical Network Diagram is needed when:\n  - The project is Large & Complex\n  - It’s critical to the organization\n  - There are specific schedule constraints\n  - Specific cost constraints\n  - Specific quality requirements\n  - Limited resources\n  - Differences of opinion regarding task sequence & dependency\n\nThe Network Diagram:\n  - Put sufficient flipchart paper landscape on a flat wall surface . \n  - By positioning the post-its on flipchart paper you’ll be able to roll \n    up the flipchart paper & move your diagram as your team \n    continues to work on it.\n  - Overlap the pages so that when you connect the tasks you’ll be \n    able to draw lines across the pages.\n  - Initially just get all tasks & work packages up so you can see \n    what you have, identifying the specific dependencies will unfold \n    as you follow the recommended steps.\n  - This is an iterative process\n  - The Network Diagram identifies the critical path.  The Critical \n    Path in project management terms is not necessarily the \n    English definition of the word critical\n  - You’ll be brainstorming what comes before & what comes after \n    each task or work package & inserting the connecting lines\n  - As you do this leave space between each item so you have \n    room for the lines\n  - Building the network diagram will help identify tasks or work \n    packages that may need to be added or modified\n  - As you create the network ignore any predefined schedule \n    assumptions or requirements.  Creating the schedule will be the \n    next step.\n  - Ideally you would want the person or persons who will be doing \n    or managing the work participating either as you create the \n    network or validating it later. \n\nBuilding the Network Diagram:\n    1. Record all Tasks and/or Work Packages on Post-it notes\n    2. Include Start Project on the left & End Project on the right\n    3. Initially position Tasks and/or Work Packages in rough \n        relative sequence\n    4. Add significant milestones to identify progress, milestones = \n        0 duration & effort\n    5. Connect all Tasks and/or Work Packages validated by the \n        owners\n    6. Brainstorm duration & work effort with the owners using a \n        consistent metric\n    7. Identify the longest duration path, that's the Critical Path\n    8. Add the longest / Critical Path to determine the project’s end \n        date\n    9. Add the work effort to determine the total labor required\n\n  - For critical projects do this work for as long as is comfortable, 1 \n    – 2 hours & come back to it at another time. \n  - If you have access to project management software that \n    includes dependencies you can now enter your information into \n    the software & let it calculate the critical path.\n  - Whether you calculate it manually or have software do it, by \n    highlighting the critical path in red on your flipchart paper you’ll \n    have a tool to do what-if analysis that can    \n    otherwise be cumbersome in most project management \n    software.\n  - When project management software that includes \n    dependencies determines your schedule it will use the project \n    start date, the working days & hours for each \n    individual resource & any non-working or holidays that have \n    been entered.\n  - This is typically where the novice user of the software can \n    become confused & feel like the software has a mind of its own.\n  - Defaults in the software may be set that appear to cause \n    surprises.\n  - Use the simplest approach that will meet your needs.  If you’re \n    not familiar with the software you can always continue using the \n    manual post-it approach.\n  - For critical projects invite people who were not part of creating \n    the network to listen as you walk through & explain each task & \n    work package to help validate the \n    sequence & the completeness of your plan.\n  - It’s typical for project customers & sponsors to set completion \n    targets prior to allowing the project team to do the appropriate \n    planning, they want it done fast.  \n  - Prior to identifying & validating task dependency project \n    schedules are at best an estimate or a guess.  \n  - If the Network Diagram’s calculated schedule is longer than \n    required you now have the data to “Crash” or reduce project \n    time. \n  - Maintaining the network diagram every time there is a change \n    can add overhead to managing the project.  \n  - For some projects it can be absolutely critical that each change \n    in duration & dependency is monitored & managed.\n  - For many projects creating the network at the beginning of the \n    project to understand & define dependency and initial duration \n    but not maintain the network may be \n    enough.  This is especially true when dependency doesn’t \n    change but only duration changes.  In these cases a manual \n    process of hand shakes between task or work \n    package owners with oversight from the project manager can \n    be established to monitor & respond to the duration changes.\n",

Not all work package tasks need to \n  be entered.\n\n- Shawn & Stephen will have weekly Zoom meetings typically on \n  Mondays to review progress, set priorities for the week, & \n  discuss plans & designs for future work\n\n- The marketing partner, when hired, & Stephen will have weekly \n  phone meetings to review progress, set priorities for the week, & \n  discuss plans, & designs for future work.\n\n- Until a color coded status is implemented the following \n  convention will be used:\n.   \"<\" as the first character for a deliverable or work package \n    indicates work has started\n    \">\" as the first character for a deliverable or work package \n    indicates completion\n    No character indicates not started\n\n- The weekly priorities & backlog list are being maintained in the \n   Project Notes",

It looks \n  like it keeps working & saving data. Have an error message \n  appear when internet is lost.\n",

              "help": "Launch the Project and Establish the Teams:\n\n- This is the official start for most business projects \n\n- Describe how the project will be launched, who will be involved in \n  launching it, and what information will be made available or has \n  been made available for the launch.\n\n- Verify you have all required background information and are \n  ready to launch the project. \n\n- Projects started in haste without adequate information typically \n  become problem projects. Describe how the project will be \n  launched. \n\n- Define the teams, at a minimum you'll have a core team, with the \n  members that will be actively involved throughout the entire \n  project. \n\n- Many projects, also require extended teams, that work on \n  specific portions of the project. \n\n- Your project team can be your biggest asset, it can also be your \n  biggest risk. \n\n- Take the time to get to know every team member, and develop \n  effective relationships. \n\n- The more significant the project the more administration will be \n  required and the more you'll want to establish the administration \n  prior to the launch\n\n- It's important to have the project's sponsor and core team \n  actively participate in the launch\n\n- Research confirms that projects with active sponsors are always \n  more successful than projects without sponsors\n\nProject Teams:\n    - How many & what kind of teams will be required?\n    - Who’s the project sponsor & what’s the sponsor’s involvement \n      in the project?\n    - Who are key project stakeholders & what’s their involvement in \n      the project?\n    - Who’s the project manager & team leader for each team or \n      sub-team?\n    - What departments need to be represented on the project core \n      team?\n    - Who are the core team members & what are their roles & \n      responsibilities?\n    - What skills are required on the project core team?\n    - How often & when will project team meetings be held?\n    - Who will be required to participate in project team meetings?\n    - How will project team decisions be made?\n    - How will project team meetings be managed?\n    - What’s the escalation process?\n    - How will project team performance issues be handled?\n    - Who will record & track the schedule, action items & issues?\n    - Who will record assumptions?\n    - What automated tools will be used?\n    - Do team members need any training?\n\nProject Sponsors:\n  - Sponsors will generally be Senior Managers who have ultimate \n    responsibility for the successful completion of Business \n    Initiatives\n  - Sponsor Responsibilities Gives direction to the project\n  - Obtains necessary resources including commitment of people & \n    hours across the organization\n  - Secures management agreements\n  - Provides regular reports to management team\n  - Is committed to ensuring results are achieved\n  - Provides assistance / guidance to project manager\n  - Provides political support\n  - The sponsor will usually be involved in launching the project. \n  - It is recommended that all projects have a sponsor.\n  - The sponsor helps set the project’s direction, goals, & \n    objectives\n\nEvery Project requires a Project Manager who…..\n  - Takes the lead position in the project\n  - Facilitates the project and team process\n  - Collaborates with the team to create and execute the project \n    plan\n  - Monitors and documents the progress of all project work\n  - Reports to the Sponsor on Project Progress\n  - Facilitates & develops reporting updates to the cross-functional \n    Project Management Steering Committee\n\nThe larger, the more complex, the more critical the project the more the project manager needs to be a planner, manager, negotiator, facilitator, & communicator & not a doer.\n\nProject managers get things done.  The difference between effective and less effective project managers is whether the most important things get done.  \n\nWhile it would be great for all the identified work within a project to be completed on time, on budget, & per specifications; sometimes that’s just not feasible.  For that reason it’s important to identify & ensure that the most important or critical work is completed producing the most important or critical deliverables.\n\n​​Project managers ensure predictable results by following a defined process\n   - Develop effective habits\n   - Ask probing open ended questions\n   - Influence required behavior change\n\nWhen selecting the project manager: \n   - Understand the involvement in previous projects\n   - What's the background in project management methods and \n     tools\n   - What's the time required for this project and time availability to \n     meet the requirements.\n   - Understands and able to work with team member styles\n\nWhat Do Project Managers Do?\n1. Defines project goals, objectives, and requirements (with \n    sponsor)\n2. Builds consensus and facilitates conflict resolution\n3. Defines the project scope, WBS, & Network Diagram (if \n    required) \n4. Sets priorities and makes recommendations\n5. Forms and leads the project team & publishes all plans\n6. Ensures completion of all deliverables\n7. Minimize surprises\n8. Recognizes and rewards accomplishments and successes\n9. Provides direct communication with the sponsor\n10. Monitors delivery against all plans and commitments\n11. Coordinates and supports the project team\n12. Identifies & mitigates risk\n13. Controls changes\n14. Focal point for issues, questions, and enhancements\n15. Chairs project team meetings\n16. Facilitates problem resolution\n17. Involved in all project communication\n18. Maintains focus on behavior change required to produce the \n      committed results\n19. Manages activities during each stage\n20. Rewards team performance\n\nThe Bottom Line:\nProject managers get things done, the difference between effective and less effective project managers is whether the most important things get done.\n\n\nTeam Member Responsibilities:\n  - Understand, help develop, and support project direction, business results, & goals\n  - Participate in planning, as needed\n  - Accountable for completing tasks\n  - Support each other and the project manager\n  - Participate in problem resolution\n  - Report status, uncover issues, & communicate\n  - Keep your supervisor / manager informed of your work & time \n    commitments \n  - Participate in all reviews and audits\n\nEstablish Team Operating Procedures to Reduce Conflict:\n  - Define roles and responsibilities\n  - Establish expectations\n  - Define meeting schedules\n  - Describe the meeting process\n  - Identify automated & manual tools\n  - Establish decision making & escalation process\n  - Value individual feedback\n  - Define performance management\n  - Define documentation requirements, process, and \n    responsibilities\n  - Identify team training and development requirements\n\n",

              "help": "Define the Project's Deliverables:\n\n  - This step is the heart of your project.\n\n  - Projects produce, create, and implement deliverables. \n\n  - A deliverable is a thing, and should sound like a noun. \n\n  - We create deliverables by doing work, or tasks. \n\n  - Tasks start with a verb. Develop, design, initiate, etc, \n\n  - The most effective way to identify project deliverables, and the \n    required tasks, is to facilitate the core team in creating a \n    graphical Work Breakdown Structure W B S, using post-it notes. \n\n  - The tasks to produce a deliverable have a beginning and an \n    end, rolling up the dates for all the project's deliverables \n    becomes the project's estimated schedule.\n\n  - Completion criteria for this step is to have identified the project's \n    deliverables, and the key tasks for producing each deliverable. \n\n  - Create a graphical view or hierarchical outline of what the \n    project will deliver.\n\n  - Develop the project Work Breakdown Structure by identifying \n    the project’s deliverables, sub-deliverables, tasks & or work \n    packages.\n\n  - Using this simple approach will create clarity   \n  - The project name goes at the top \n  - The next level contains the Deliverables, i.e. nouns\n  - Sometimes Deliverables are big & need to be broken down into \n    Sub-deliverables, \n  - Sub-deliverables are also things, nouns.  \n  - Deliverables & Sub-deliverables are not necessarily one word \n    nouns, but the label should describe things.  \n  - Some deliverables are easily identified as things, some may be \n    a little more difficult.  \n  - Why is it important to identify the things the project will \n    produce?  Because you can describe a thing in a way that \n    everyone can recognize it when they work on it & implement it.  \n  - Examples; Report, Descriptions, Specifications, Training Plan, \n    Training Material, Agreement, etc.\n  - Projects produce Things that previously didn’t exist or modify \n    existing Things.   \n  - Deliverables & sub-deliverables are created by doing work, \n    work is a task.  \n  - Sometimes multiple tasks are combined into a Work Package & \n    assigned to a resource, department, or sub-contractor.  \n  - Sometimes a Work Package in one project is significant enough \n    that it needs to be managed as a project by the assigned \n    resource, department, or sub-contractor.  In that case you would \n    have a project within a project.\n\nTasks & work packages should start with a verb like create, develop, research, acquire, design, gather, negotiate, etc.\n\nTasks & work packages are what get scheduled\n\nWe strongly recommend not going beyond 3 levels in your Work Breakdown Structure.  Deliverables, Sub-deliverables, & Tasks or Work Packages.  When you add more levels you’ll be adding complexity that will be harder to manage\n\nAll work within the project must be in the WBS.  That includes the work of planning & managing the project.  \n\nProject Management is the first Deliverable for all projects.  Not all projects need all phases of the project process.  A two week project may only need two phases – The Planning Phase of create the WBS, develop the schedule, assign the tasks, & monitor the work & the second phase being Implement & Post-op.plus the deliverables.\n\nHere’s an important rule for managing project scope – If it’s in the WBS it’s in the project\n\nIf it’s not in the WBS it’s not in the project.  Ideas & suggestions that don’t fit the needs for the current project go on a list for possibly being part of the next version or a different project\n",

Determine if you're comfortable that you have & understand the \n    summary & detailed requirements from these most impacted \n    groups.\n4. If you're not sure you have & understand all the requirements, \n    consider facilitating a focus group of representatives from the \n    most impacted groups to gather and validate their requirements.\n\n\nThe elements to discuss & gather from each group include:\n  - Their view of the project’s goals\n  - Their needs & wants\n  - Current business state\n  - Key assumptions\n  - Technology requirements\n  - Quality requirements\n  - Organizational considerations. \n\n \n\n    What are their assumptions?\n    Why do they believe that…?\n    It appears that they are assuming…?\n    What are the assumptions that appear to be driving resistance within the groups?\n    What are the assumptions that appear to be driving support within the groups?\n    What’s the risk of proceeding with certain assumptions?\n    What are the group’s requirements and specifications?\n    How will we assess and validate the requirements and specifications?\n    What are the technology requirements and specifications?\n    How will we assess and validate the technology requirements and specifications?\n    What are the quality / performance requirements?\n    How will we assess and validate the quality requirements and specifications?\n    How will we know this item has been completed?\n​\n\nStep seven, Additional Requirements, Depending on the project, initial requirements have already been shared during the first six steps. Additional requirements can come from multiple groups, such as customers, management, project sponsor, stakeholders, users of the intended solution, groups impacted by the problem and proposed solution, regulators, citizens, and local, state, and federal government. Identify the groups that will be providing the summary and detailed requirements for your project. Consider meeting with representatives from the key groups, facilitate a session for gathering the following information, group's goals and objective for the project, their needs and wants, their current state, key assumptions, solution requirements, technology requirements, quality requirements, and organizational considerations.  Ask open ended questions, document the requirements, review each requirement, decide which ones will be met, provide feedback to the groups explaining the results of the meetings, decisions and reasons for the actions to be taken.

              "help": "Define Dependencies:\n\n  - Identifying, tracking, & continuously updating the dependency between tasks and/or work packages is a key part of any project.  \n  - The sequence or dependency of the work i.e. knowing what comes before & what follows will determine the project’s schedule.  \n  - The more work that can be done in parallel the shorter the project, the more work in a linear sequence the longer the project.  \n  - There are two kinds of time associated with project tasks, duration and work effort.\n  - Work Effort – The amount of time required to perform a task for all resources involved in the task (work effort drives the labor cost)\n  - Duration – The available calendar time required to perform the task. (duration drives the project schedule)\n  - The Critical Path: The path with the longest duration path, it Is the project schedule.\n  - The crirical path can change as the work changes throughout a project, and it needs to be monitored & managed\n  - The Network Diagram produces a calculated schedule based on data.\n  - A particular task may require 4 hours of work effort, 2 hours each for 2 resources, but it may be spread out over 8 calendar days\n  - The dependency of the work within small projects can be easily identified.  \n  - The tool for identifying dependency in medium to large project is the Network Diagram.  \n  - Determining task dependency is a skill every project manager & team member needs.  \n  -​ The most effective way to create the network diagram for a project is to facilitate the core team in building it using post-it notes\n\nJust as we recommended creating the Work Breakdown Structure with post-it notes we also recommend creating a graphical Network Diagram with post-it notes before entering the information into any software\n\nThe graphical Network Diagram is used to identify task sequence & dependency\n  - Not all projects need a graphical Network Diagram.\n  - Creating & maintaining a graphical Network Diagram takes time, however it produces clarity,  engagement, commitment, & a calculated schedule\n  - All projects need task sequence & dependency\n  - Sometimes a Network Diagram may only be needed to clarify a portion of a project\n\nGraphical Network Diagram is needed when:\n  - The project is Large & Complex\n  - It’s critical to the organization\n  - There are specific schedule constraints\n  - Specific cost constraints\n  - Specific quality requirements\n  - Limited resources\n  - Differences of opinion regarding task sequence & dependency\n\nThe Network Diagram:\n  - Put sufficient flipchart paper landscape on a flat wall surface . \n  - By positioning the post-its on flipchart paper you’ll be able to roll up the flipchart paper & move your diagram as your team continues to work on it.\n  - Overlap the pages so that when you connect the tasks you’ll be able to draw lines across the pages.\n  - Initially just get all tasks & work packages up so you can see what you have, identifying the specific dependencies will unfold as you follow the recommended steps.\n  - This is an iterative process\n  - The Network Diagram identifies the critical path.  The Critical Path in project management terms is not necessarily the English definition of the word critical\n  - You’ll be brainstorming what comes before & what comes after each task or work package & inserting the connecting lines\n  - As you do this leave space between each item so you have room for the lines\n  - Building the network diagram will help identify tasks or work packages that may need to be added or modified\n  - As you create the network ignore any predefined schedule assumptions or requirements.  Creating the schedule will be the next step.\n  - Ideally you would want the person or persons who will be doing or managing the work participating either as you create the network or validating it later. \n\nBuilding the Network Diagram:\n    1. Record all Tasks and/or Work Packages on Post-it notes\n    2. Include Start Project on the left & End Project on the right\n    3. Initially position Tasks and/or Work Packages in rough relative sequence\n    4. Add significant milestones to identify progress, milestones = 0 duration & effort\n    5. Connect all Tasks and/or Work Packages validated by the owners\n    6. Brainstorm duration & work effort with the owners using a consistent metric\n    7. Identify the longest duration path, that's the Critical Path\n    8. Add the longest / Critical Path to determine the project’s end date\n    9. Add the work effort to determine the total labor required\n\n  - For critical projects do this work for as long as is comfortable, 1 – 2 hours & come back to it at another time. \n  - If you have access to project management software that includes dependencies you can now enter your information into the software & let it calculate the critical path.\n  - Whether you calculate it manually or have software do it, by highlighting the critical path in red on your flipchart paper you’ll have a tool to do what-if analysis that can    \n    otherwise be cumbersome in most project management software.\n  - When project management software that includes dependencies determines your schedule it will use the project start date, the working days & hours for each \n    individual resource & any non-working or holidays that have been entered.\n  - This is typically where the novice user of the software can become confused & feel like the software has a mind of its own.\n  - Defaults in the software may be set that appear to cause surprises.\n  - Use the simplest approach that will meet your needs.  If you’re not familiar with the software you can always continue using the manual post-it approach.\n  - For critical projects invite people who were not part of creating the network to listen as you walk through & explain each task & work package to help validate the \n    sequence & the completeness of your plan.\n  - It’s typical for project customers & sponsors to set completion targets prior to allowing the project team to do the appropriate planning, they want it done fast.  \n  - Prior to identifying & validating task dependency project schedules are at best an estimate or a guess.  \n  - If the Network Diagram’s calculated schedule is longer than required you now have the data to “Crash” or reduce project time. \n  - Maintaining the network diagram every time there is a change can add overhead to managing the project.  \n  - For some projects it can be absolutely critical that each change in duration & dependency is monitored & managed.\n  - For many projects creating the network at the beginning of the project to understand & define dependency and initial duration but not maintain the network may be \n    enough.  This is especially true when dependency doesn’t change but only duration changes.  In these cases a manual process of hand shakes between task or work \n    package owners with oversight from the project manager can be established to monitor & respond to the duration changes.\n",

Additional requirements can come from multiple groups, such as customers, management, project sponsor, stakeholders, users of the intended solution, groups impacted by the problem and proposed solution, regulators, citizens, and local, state, and federal government. Identify the groups that will be providing the summary and detailed requirements for your project. Consider meeting with representatives from the key groups, facilitate a session for gathering the following information, group's goals and objective for the project, their needs and wants, their current state, key assumptions, solution requirements, technology requirements, quality requirements, and organizational considerations.  Ask open ended questions, document the requirements, review each requirement, decide which ones will be met, provide feedback to the groups explaining the results of the meetings, decisions and reasons for the actions to be taken. If you would like more detail for this step, say Project Requirements, When you have sufficient information, continue to the next step by saying, Step Eight.\n\n\n",

Additional requirements can come from multiple groups, such as customers, management, project sponsor, stakeholders, users of the intended solution, groups impacted by the problem and proposed solution, regulators, citizens, and local, state, and federal government. Identify the groups that will be providing the summary and detailed requirements for your project. Consider meeting with representatives from the key groups, facilitate a session for gathering the following information, group's goals and objective for the project, their needs and wants, their current state, key assumptions, solution requirements, technology requirements, quality requirements, and organizational considerations.  Ask open ended questions, document the requirements, review each requirement, decide which ones will be met, provide feedback to the groups explaining the results of the meetings, decisions and reasons for the actions to be taken. If you would like more detail for this step, say Project Requirements, When you have sufficient information, continue to the next step by saying, Step Eight.\n\n\n",

Additional requirements can come from multiple groups, such as customers, management, project sponsor, stakeholders, users of the intended solution, groups impacted by the problem and proposed solution, regulators, citizens, and local, state, and federal government. Identify the groups that will be providing the summary and detailed requirements for your project. Consider meeting with representatives from the key groups, facilitate a session for gathering the following information, group's goals and objective for the project, their needs and wants, their current state, key assumptions, solution requirements, technology requirements, quality requirements, and organizational considerations.  Ask open ended questions, document the requirements, review each requirement, decide which ones will be met, provide feedback to the groups explaining the results of the meetings, decisions and reasons for the actions to be taken. If you would like more detail for this step, say Project Requirements, When you have sufficient information, continue to the next step by saying, Step Eight.\n\n\n",

Additional requirements can come from multiple groups, such as customers, management, project sponsor, stakeholders, users of the intended solution, groups impacted by the problem and proposed solution, regulators, citizens, and local, state, and federal government. Identify the groups that will be providing the summary and detailed requirements for your project. Consider meeting with representatives from the key groups, facilitate a session for gathering the following information, group's goals and objective for the project, their needs and wants, their current state, key assumptions, solution requirements, technology requirements, quality requirements, and organizational considerations.  Ask open ended questions, document the requirements, review each requirement, decide which ones will be met, provide feedback to the groups explaining the results of the meetings, decisions and reasons for the actions to be taken. If you would like more detail for this step, say Project Requirements, When you have sufficient information, continue to the next step by saying, Step Eight.\n\n\n"

Additional requirements can come from multiple groups, such as customers, management, project sponsor, stakeholders, users of the intended solution, groups impacted by the problem and proposed solution, regulators, citizens, and local, state, and federal government. Identify the groups that will be providing the summary and detailed requirements for your project. Consider meeting with representatives from the key groups, facilitate a session for gathering the following information, group's goals and objective for the project, their needs and wants, their current state, key assumptions, solution requirements, technology requirements, quality requirements, and organizational considerations.  Ask open ended questions, document the requirements, review each requirement, decide which ones will be met, provide feedback to the groups explaining the results of the meetings, decisions and reasons for the actions to be taken. If you would like more detail for this step, say Project Requirements, When you have sufficient information, continue to the next step by saying, Step Eight.\n\n\n",

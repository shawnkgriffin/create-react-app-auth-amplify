    "Tips": "How was this project initiated? Basic PM Slides\nWho will be the sponsor?\nWas this project type done before?\nWhat metric or goal will this project affect?\nHas the business problem been clearly stated?\nWhy are we doing this project?\n\nUnerstanding a project's background establishes a solid foundation for the project.\n\nAt a minimum, it would be important to know who initiated the project, how the project was initiated, and why it was initiated. \n\nThe more you know and understand about the background the better.  Has this project type been done before, if so what were the results? Are there any related successes that can be cloned or leveraged? What metric or goal will this project affect? Has the business problem been clearly stated?  The steps may change as your project evolves. Describing your project's background is the first title, or step in your project plan, (Changed 7-30-19, Not Uploaded)\n\nGather project background information.  Describe why this project is needed, how it supports the organization’s goals, what problem it will solve, & what the key requirements are.  Pre-launch information is preliminary, gather what’s available, expanded & clarify the information as the project progresses.\n\n Projects solve or minimize problems & or create new opportunities.  Having a clear description of the problem or problems to be addressed will create focus.  Ensuring that all team members have a common understanding of the problem will enable project success.  If key individuals don't agree with the problem, they won't agree with the proposed solution.\n\n​Gather project background information.  Describe why this project is needed, how it supports the organization’s goals, what problem it will solve, & what the key requirements are.  Pre-launch information is preliminary, gather what’s available, expanded & clarify the information as the project progresses.\n\n Brainstorm the presenting / initial idea to determine its scope & the viability of moving forward.  Ideas for projects & action items can come from many places.  They can be the result of senior management planning, customer requirements, employee suggestions, responses to daily problems, suggestions for leveraging new technology, etc., etc., etc.  Recognize that the presenting idea can change as you apply the project management process,  How ideas are handled are determined by the organization's culture.  An open & collaborative culture will welcome new ideas & have a way to process the idea while closed organizations may limit & even discourage new ideas.\n\n​\n\nThe key question to automatically ask whenever a new idea surfaces is: What problem will this solve?  Recognize that how the problem is defined will determine the direction of the proposed solution.\n\n​\n\nGuidance Questions Small Project: \n\n    Where did the idea come from?\n    Who's idea was it?\n    Is this part of a broader plan?\n    Does this idea support to organization's long term goals?\n    Will the person who came up with the idea continue to be involved to help ensure success?\n    Are there any key people who will disagree with the idea?\n    Are there any major barriers to moving forward with the idea?\n    Is this really a project, an action item, or someone's daily activity?\n    What problem will this solve?\n    Is this a new idea or has it been proposed before?\n    If it was proposed before why did it come up again?\n    Is now the right time to move forward with this idea?\n\nGuidance Questions Medium Project:\n    What do we need before we can start this work?\n    Have we done this type of project before?\n    Have we gathered & reviewed all available information from previous similar project(s).\n    Have we assessed the results, comments. problems, & lessons learned from previous similar project(s).\n    Review problems encountered & suggested solutions.\n    Review lessons learned & recommendations.\n    Does the company have a defined project commissioning process that senior management follows for business planning, project identification & vetting, & project monitoring?\n    Does the company have a defined Project Management Process?​\n    Was senior management involved in vetting and initiating this project?\n    Does the company have a defined format for project plans?​\n    Who is the project sponsor?\n    What business strategy or initiative does it support?\n    Who will be the project manager?\n    What departments or stakeholders need to be represented on the core team?\n    What’s the current business environment?\n    What’s the organization’s current status, are there any major issues?\n    Is the organization in crisis, business as usual, or growth?\n    What’s the project’s priority?\n    What’s the project’s background / history?\n    What’s the proposed business problem?\n    Are there defined business goals & objectives?\n    What are the expected measurable business results?\n    How will project success be determined?\n    Are there any budget limits?\n    Are there any scheduling issues?\n    Will the project requirements & potential solution fit with the organization’s maturity & culture?\n\n\nGuidance Questions: Brazonics\n    What problem or problems need to be solved?\n    What's the opportunity to be created?\n    Is there more than one problem?\n    Has this problem been previously addressed? \n    Why does this problem need to be solved?\n    How will we know this task was completed?\n\nGuidance Questions: Large Project\n    What do we need before we can start this work?\n    Who is the project sponsor?\n    What business strategy or initiative does it support?\n    Who will be the project manager?\n    What departments or stakeholders need to be represented on the core team?\n    What’s the current business environment?\n    What’s the organization’s current status, are there any major issues?\n    Is the organization in crisis, business as usual, or growth?\n    What’s the project’s priority?\n    What’s the project’s background / history?\n    What’s the proposed business problem?\n    Are there defined business goals & objectives?\n    What are the expected measurable business results?\n    How will project success be determined?\n    Are there any budget limits?\n    Are there any scheduling issues?\n    Will the project requirements & potential solution fit with the organization’s maturity & culture?\n    How will we know this deliverable was completed?\n\nRecord your findings along with any other appropriate information for this step in a shared document. Update the document with each subsequent step's information. This will be the team's working project plan (Changed 7-30-19, Not Uploaded)\n\nRecord your findings in the project plan document, a template is available at www dot, continuous, business change, dot com, slash alexa, project plan, store the document so it can be accessed by the project teams, and track progress through each of your project's steps.\n"

    "Tips": "\nEvery Project requires a Project Manager who…..\n\n    Takes the lead position in the project\n\n    Facilitates the team process\n\n    Collaborates with the team to create and execute the project plan\n\n    Monitors and documents the progress of all project work\n\n    Reports to the Sponsor on Project Process\n\n    Facilitates & develops reporting updates to the cross-functional Project Management Steering Committee\n\n \n\nThe larger, the more complex, the more critical the project the more the project manager needs to be a planner, manager, negotiator, facilitator, & communicator & not a doer.\n\n​\n\nProject managers get things done.  The difference between effective and less effective project managers is whether the most important things get done.  While it would be great for all the identified work within a project to be completed on time, on budget, & per specifications; sometimes that’s just not feasible.  For that reason it’s important to identify & ensure that the most important or critical work is completed producing the most important or critical deliverables.\n\n​\n\nWhat’s absolutely necessary before the solution can go-live?\n\n​​\n\nHow can project managers ensure predictable results?\n\n    Follow a defined process\n\n    Develop effective habits\n\n    Ask probing open ended questions\n\n    Influence required behavior change\n\n​\n\nVideo clip of Peter Falk as Columbo, example of asking open ended probing questions.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZiv8vkxMac \n\n    Acts as though he's confused & in a hurry\n\n    Asks seemingly dumb questions\n\n    No ego\n\n    Makes it appear that the questions he asks occurred to him on the fly when in fact he planned each question prior to the meeting\n\n    ​Included a balance between fact oriented questions & relationship oriented statements & questions\n\n​\n\nIdentify the project manager, describe the involvement in previous projects, background in project management, time required for this project, & time availability to meet the requirements.\n\n \n\nGuidance Questions:\n\n    What do we need before we can start this work?\n\n    Who will be the project manager?\n\n    Has this person managed previous projects?\n\n    Has this person been involved in this type of project?\n\n    Is this person familiar with the project process & tools that will be required?\n\n    Will the project manager require help & coaching from the sponsor?\n\n    Will the project manager need help facilitating team meetings?\n\n    Will the project manager need administrative support?\n\n    Will the project manager need help with project communication?\n\n    Will the project manager need help from technical experts?\n\n    Will the project manager need help from financial experts?\n\n    Will the project manager need help in dealing with difficult people?\n\n    How will we know this deliverable has been completed?\n\n​\n\n- Understand Team member styles\n- Sponsors will generally be Senior Managers who have ultimate responsibility for the successful completion of Business Initiatives….. \n- Sponsor Responsibilities Gives direction to the project\nObtains necessary resources including commitment of people & hours across the organization\nSecures management agreements\nProvides regular reports to management team\nIs committed to ensuring results are achieved\nProvides assistance / guidance to project manager\nProvides political support\nCreates project profile \nSponsors will generally be Senior Managers who have ultimate responsibility for the successful completion of the project. The sponsor will usually be involved in launching the project. It is recommended that all projects have a sponsor.  The sponsor helps set the project’s direction, goals, & objectives, obtains necessary resources, commitments for participation across departments, secures management agreements, provides regular updates to the management team, provides assistance, guidance, & coaching to the project manager, & provides political support.\n\n​\n\nGuidance Questions: \n\n    What do we need before we can start this work?\n\n    Who is the project sponsor?\n\n    Is the sponsor a senior manager?\n\n    Has the sponsor been a previous project sponsor?\n\n    Will the sponsor need some coaching on being a project sponsor?\n\n    Will the sponsor be involved in launching the project?\n\n    What will be the sponsor’s involvement in the project?\n\n    What meetings will the sponsor attend?\n\n    What information will the sponsor require & how often?\n\n    Will the sponsor help resolve cross-functional issues that may arise?\n\n    How will we know this deliverable has been completed?\n\n    How will we know this task was completed?\n\n​\n\nEvery Project requires a Project Manager who….. \nTakes the lead position in the project\nFacilitates the team process \nCollaborates with the team to create and execute the project plan\nMonitors and documents the progress of the project\nReports to the Sponsor on Project Process\n\n\nWhat Do PM Do?\n1. Defines project goals, objectives, and requirements (with sponsor)\n3. Defines the project scope, WBS, & Network Diagram (if required) \n5. Forms and leads the project team & publishes all plans\n8. Recognizes and rewards accomplishments and successes\n10. Monitors delivery against all plans and commitments\n12. Identifies & mitigates risk\n13. Controls changes\n15. Chairs project team meetings\n17. Involved in all project communication\n19. Manages activities during each stage\n2. Builds consensus and facilitates conflict resolution\n4. Sets priorities and makes recommendations\n6. Ensures completion of all deliverables\n7. Minimize surprises\n9. Provides direct communication with the sponsor\n11. Coordinates and supports the project team\n14. Focal point for issues, questions, and enhancements\n16. Facilitates problem resolution\n18. Maintains focus on behavior change required to produce the committed results\n20. Rewards team performance\n\nThe Bottom Line:\nProject managers get things done. \n The difference between effective and less\n   effective project managers is whether the most\n   important things get done.\n\nHow can you ensure predictable results?\nFollow a defined process\nDevelop effective habits\nAsk questions\n\nTeam Member Responsibilities:\nUnderstand, help develop, and support project direction, business results, & goals\nParticipate in planning, as needed\nAccountable for completing tasks\nSupport each other and the project manager\nParticipate in problem resolution\nReport status, uncover issues, & communicate\nKeep your supervisor / manager informed of your work & time commitments \nParticipate in all reviews and audits\n\nTeam Conflict Resolution\n\nTeam Operating Procedures:\nRoles and responsibilities\nExpectations\nMeeting schedules\nMeeting process\nAutomated & manual tools\nDecision making & escalation process\nIndividual feedback\nPerformance management\nDocumentation\nTeam training and development\n(Other)\n\nWho Are the Stakeholders?\n\n\nBrainstorm the presenting / initial idea to determine its scope & the viability of moving forward.

The project manager’s role is to help move everyone to a common understanding & agreement.  The project process is designed to enable gaining consensus on the project’s elements.\n\n \n\nDefine the teams required & each team member’s role and specific responsibilities for the project.  Define how the project team will operate regarding meetings, decision making, escalation, performance management, communication, etc.  List key stakeholders and their role and responsibilities within the project.\n\n \n\nTeam Member Responsibilities:\n\n    Understand, help develop, and support project direction, business results, & goals\n\n    Participate in planning, as needed\n\n    Accountable for completing tasks\n\n    Support each other and the project manager\n\n    Participate in problem resolution\n\n    Report status, uncover issues, & communicate\n\n    Keep your supervisor / manager informed of your work & time commitments\n\n    Participate in all reviews and audits\n\n​\n\nGuidance Questions: \n\n    What do we need before we can start this work?\n\n    How many & what kind of teams will be required?\n\n    Who’s the project sponsor & what’s the sponsor’s involvement in the project?\n\n    Who are key project stakeholders & what’s their involvement in the project?\n\n    Who’s the project manager & team leader for each team or sub-team?\n\n    What departments need to be represented on the project core team?\n\n    Who are the core team members & what are their roles & responsibilities?\n\n    What skills are required on the project core team?\n\n    How often & when will project team meetings be held?\n\n    Who will be required to participate in project team meetings?\n\n    How will project team decisions be made?\n\n    How will project team meetings be managed?\n\n    What’s the escalation process?\n\n    How will project team performance issues be handled?\n\n    Who will record & track the schedule, action items & issues?\n\n    Who will record assumptions?\n\n    What automated tools will be used?\n\n    Do team members need any training?\n\n    How will we know this deliverable was completed?\n\n\nDescribe how the project will be launched, who will be involved in launching it, and what information will be made available or has been made available for the launch.\n\n \n\nGuidance Questions: \n\n    What do we need before we can start this work?\n\n    How will the project be launched?\n\n    Will it be a formal or informal launch?\n\n    Is this a standalone project or is it part of a larger program or business initiative?\n\n    Who will be involved in launching the project?\n\n    Who was involved in launching the project?\n\n    What information will be provided to the project leader and project team?\n\n    What information was provided to the project leader and project team?\n\n    Is there any additional information that the team believes they need?\n\n    How will we know this deliverable was completed?\n\n​\n​\n\nLarge Project\nDescribe how the project will be launched, who will be involved in launching it, and what information will be made available or has been made available for the launch.\n \n\nGuidance Questions: \n    What do we need before we can start this work?\n    How will the project be launched?\n    Will it be a formal or informal launch?\n    Is this a standalone project or is it part of a larger program or business initiative?\n    Who will be involved in launching the project?\n    Who was involved in launching the project?\n    What information will be provided to the project leader and project team?\n    What information was provided to the project leader and project team?\n    Is there any additional information that the team believes they need?\n    How will we know this deliverable was completed?\n\nStep two, launch the project, and establish the teams detail. Verify you have all required background information and are ready to launch the project. Projects started in haste without adequate information typically become problem projects. Describe how the project will be launched. Define the teams, at a minimum you'll have a core team, with the members that will be actively involved throughout the entire project. Many projects, also require extended teams, that work on specific portions of the project. Your project team can be your biggest asset, it can also be your biggest risk. Take the time to get to know every team member, and develop effective relationships. If you would like more detail for this step, say Project Launch or Teams. When you have sufficient information, continue to the next step by saying, Step Three. (Changed 8-02-19, Not Uploaded)\n\n"

Compile the project information appropriate for the audience. Provide summary information for management and general stakeholders, and detailed for core team members.

Additional requirements can come from multiple groups, such as customers, management, project sponsor, stakeholders, users of the intended solution, groups impacted by the problem and proposed solution, regulators, citizens, and local, state, and federal government. Identify the groups that will be providing the summary and detailed requirements for your project. Consider meeting with representatives from the key groups, facilitate a session for gathering the following information, group's goals and objective for the project, their needs and wants, their current state, key assumptions, solution requirements, technology requirements, quality requirements, and organizational considerations.  Ask open ended questions, document the requirements, review each requirement, decide which ones will be met, provide feedback to the groups explaining the results of the meetings, decisions and reasons for the actions to be taken.
